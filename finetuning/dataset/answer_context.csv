"Most mice in the wild are eaten or die before their life span of two years is over. They die from external causes, such as disease, starvation, or predators, not due to internal causes, such as aging. That is why nature has made mice to live, on average, for no longer than two years. Now we have arrived at an important point: The average life span of an animal species, or the rate at which it ages, is determined by the average time that this animal species can survive in the wild. That explains why a bat can live to be 30 years old. In contrast to mice, bats can fly, which is why they can escape from danger much faster. Thanks to their wings, bats can also cover longer distances and are better able to find food. Every genetic change in the past that made it possible for a bat to live longer was useful, because bats are much better able than mice to flee from danger, find food, and survive.",2,2,train
"In the Indian language of pali, mettā means benevolence, kindness or tenderness. It is one of the most important ideas in Buddhism. Buddhism recommends a daily ritual meditation (known as mettā bhāvanā) to foster this attitude. The meditation begins with a call to think carefully every morning of an individual with whom one tends to get irritated or to whom one feels aggressive or cold and—in place of one’s normal hostile impulses—to rehearse kindly messages like ‘I hope you will find peace’ or ‘I wish you to be free from suffering’. This practice can be extended outwards ultimately to include pretty much everyone on Earth. The background assumption is that, with the right stimulus, our feelings towards people are not fixed and unalterable, but open to deliberate change and improvement. Compassion is a learnable skill, and we need to direct it as much towards those we are tempted to dismiss and detest as to those we love.",3,3,train
"A musical score within any film can add an additional layer to the film text, which goes beyond simply imitating the action viewed. In films that tell of futuristic worlds, composers, much like sound designers, have added freedom to create a world that is unknown and new to the viewer. However, unlike sound designers, composers often shy away from creating unique pieces that reflect these new worlds and often present musical scores that possess familiar structures and cadences. While it is possible that this may interfere with creativity and a sense of space and time, it in fact aids in viewer access to the film. Through recognizable scores, visions of the future or a galaxy far, far away can be placed within a recognizable context. Such familiarity allows the viewer to be placed in a comfortable space so that the film may then lead the viewer to what is an unfamiliar, but acceptable vision of a world different from their own.",2,3,train
"We understand that the segregation of our consciousness into present, past, and future is both a fiction and an oddly self-referential framework; your present was part of your mother’s future, and your children’s past will be in part your present. Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works well enough. In the case of climate change, however, the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has been desperately misleading and has, most importantly, hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that we face the facts but then deny our responsibility. It is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and future do not arise naturally.",5,3,train
"In both the arts and the sciences, an aesthetics of simplicity facilitates the precise communication of messages. Both are also fairly systematic. Although many people believe that art is by definition wild and intuitive, while only science is methodologically disciplined, there is a great deal of evidence—including from artists talking about their own practices—to suggest that art is often created methodically and systematically, and that frameworks and forms permit creativity to flow. Instead of being liberating, freedom without limits is almost paralysing, because without frameworks we end up in a vacuum in which our actions generate no response. As the Danish poet and filmmaker Jørgen Leth has put it many times, ‘the rules of the game’ are a prerequisite for artistic freedom. They provide a solid form or structure that enables the artist to make use of ‘the gifts of chance’ (to use Leth’s expression), and in which a part of the world can be exhibited in a non­chaotic manner. In order to create beauty, the artist must restrict him­ or herself.",1,3,train
"Coincidence that is statistically impossible seems to us like an irrational event, and some define it as a miracle. But, as Montaigne has said, “the origin of a miracle is in our ignorance, at the level of our knowledge of nature, and not in nature itself.” Glorious miracles have been later on discovered to be obedience to the laws of nature or a technological development that was not widely known at the time. As the German poet, Goethe, phrased it: “Things that are mysterious are not yet miracles.” The miracle assumes the intervention of a “higher power” in its occurrence that is beyond human capability to grasp. Yet there are methodical and simple ways to “cause a miracle” without divine revelation and inspiration. Instead of checking it out, investigating and finding the source of the event, we define it as a miracle. The miracle, then, is the excuse of those who are too lazy to think.",1,2,train
"That people need other people is hardly news, but for Rousseau this dependence extended far beyond companionship or even love, into the very process of becoming human. Rousseau believed that people are not born but made, every individual a bundle of potentials whose realization requires the active involvement of other people. Self-development is a social process. Self-sufficiency is an impossible fantasy. Much of the time Rousseau wished passionately that it were not: Robinson Crusoe was a favorite book, and he yearned to be free from the pains and uncertainties of social life. But his writings document with extraordinary clarity the shaping of the individual by his emotional attachments. “Our sweetest existence is relative and collective, and our true self is not entirely within us.” And it is kindness―which Rousseau analyzed under the rubric of pitié, which translates as “pity” but is much closer to “sympathy” as Hume and Smith defined it―that is the key to this collective existence.",3,3,train
"A good many scientists and artists have noticed the universality of creativity. At the Sixteenth Nobel Conference, held in 1980, scientists, musicians, and philosophers all agreed, to quote Freeman Dyson, that “the analogies between science and art are very good as long as you are talking about the creation and the performance. The creation is certainly very analogous. The aesthetic pleasure of the craftsmanship of performance is also very strong in science.” A few years later, at another multidisciplinary conference, physicist Murray Gell-Mann found that “everybody agrees on where ideas come from. We had a seminar here, about ten years ago, including several painters, a poet, a couple of writers, and the physicists. Everybody agrees on how it works. All of these people, whether they are doing artistic work or scientific work, are trying to solve a problem.”",4,2,train
"The elements any particular animal needs are relatively predictable. They are predictable based on the past: what an animal’s ancestors needed is likely to be what that animal also needs. Taste preferences, therefore, can be hardwired. Consider sodium (Na). The bodies of terrestrial vertebrates, including those of mammals, tend to have a concentration of sodium nearly fifty times that of the primary producers on land, plants. This is, in part, because vertebrates evolved in the sea and so evolved cells dependent upon the ingredients that were common in the sea, including sodium. To remedy the difference between their needs for sodium and that available in plants, herbivores can eat fifty times more plant material than they otherwise need (and eliminate the excess). Or they can seek out other sources of sodium. The salt taste receptor rewards animals for doing the latter, seeking out salt in order to satisfy their great need.",1,2,train
"Literature can be helpful in the language learning process because of the personal involvement it fosters in readers. Core language teaching materials must concentrate on how a language operates both as a rule-based system and as a sociosemantic system. Very often, the process of learning is essentially analytic, piecemeal, and, at the level of the personality, fairly superficial. Engaging imaginatively with literature enables learners to shift the focus of their attention beyond the more mechanical aspects of the foreign language system. When a novel, play or short story is explored over a period of time, the result is that the reader begins to ‘inhabit’ the text. He or she is drawn into the book. Pinpointing what individual words or phrases may mean becomes less important than pursuing the development of the story. The reader is eager to find out what happens as events unfold; he or she feels close to certain characters and shares their emotional responses. The language becomes ‘transparent’―the fiction draws the whole person into its own world.",5,3,train
"Hearing is basically a specialized form of touch. Sound is simply vibrating air which the ear picks up and converts to electrical signals, which are then interpreted by the brain. The sense of hearing is not the only sense that can do this; touch can do this too. If you are standing by the road and a large truck goes by, do you hear or feel the vibration? The answer is both. With very low frequency vibration the ear starts becoming inefficient and the rest of the bodys sense of touch starts to take over. For some reason we tend to make a distinction between hearing a sound and feeling a vibration, but in reality they are the same thing. Deafness does not mean that you cant hear, only that there is something wrong with the ears. Even someone who is totally deaf can still hear/feel sounds.",1,2,train
"Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may even be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply ‘weirdos’. How, then, do they ever have any influence over the majority? The social psychologist Serge Moscovici claims that the answer lies in their behavioural style, i.e. the way the minority gets its point across. The crucial factor in the success of the suffragette movement was that its supporters were consistent in their views, and this created a considerable degree of social influence. Minorities that are active and organised, who support and defend their position consistently, can create social conflict, doubt and uncertainty among members of the majority, and ultimately this may lead to social change. Such change has often occurred because a minority has converted others to its point of view. Without the influence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no social change. Many of what we now regard as ‘major’ social movements (e.g. Christianity, trade unionism or feminism) were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority.",1,3,train
"Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into our biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as bad and to sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations, however, the boundary between good and bad is a reference point that changes over time and depends on the immediate circumstances. Imagine that you are out in the country on a cold night, inadequately dressed for the pouring rain, your clothes soaked. A stinging cold wind completes your misery. As you wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter from the fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable because it functions, as pleasure normally does, to indicate the direction of a biologically significant improvement of circumstances. The pleasant relief will not last very long, of course, and you will soon be shivering behind the rock again, driven by your renewed suffering to seek better shelter.",3,3,train
"It is important to recognise the interdependence between individual, culturally formed actions and the state of cultural integration. People work within the forms provided by the cultural patterns that they have internalised, however contradictory these may be. Ideas are worked out as logical implications or consequences of other accepted ideas, and it is in this way that cultural innovations and discoveries are possible. New ideas are discovered through logical reasoning, but such discoveries are inherent in and integral to the conceptual system and are made possible only because of the acceptance of its premises. For example, the discoveries of new prime numbers are ‘real’ consequences of the particular number system employed. Thus, cultural ideas show ‘advances’ and ‘developments’ because they are outgrowths of previous ideas. The cumulative work of many individuals produces a corpus of knowledge within which certain ‘discoveries’ become possible or more likely. Such discoveries are ‘ripe’ and could not have occurred earlier and are also likely to be made simultaneously by numbers of individuals.",1,3,train
"Any attempt to model musical behavior or perception in a general way is filled with difficulties. With regard to models of perception, the question arises of whose perception we are trying to model―even if we confine ourselves to a particular culture and historical environment. Surely the perception of music varies greatly between listeners of different levels of training; indeed, a large part of music education is devoted to developing and enriching (and therefore likely changing) these listening processes. While this may be true, I am concerned here with fairly basic aspects of perception―particularly meter and key―which I believe are relatively consistent across listeners. Anecdotal evidence suggests, for example, that most people are able to ‘‘find the beat’’ in a typical folk song or classical piece. This is not to say that there is complete uniformity in this regard― there may be occasional disagreements, even among experts, as to how we hear the tonality or meter of a piece. But I believe the commonalities between us far outweigh the differences.",4,3,train
"It is important to note that the primary goal of the professional athlete as well as many adults—winning—is far less important to children. In one of our own studies, we found that teams’ won­lost records had nothing to do with how much young athletes liked their coaches or with their desire to play for the same coaches again. Interestingly, however, success of the team was related to how much the children thought their parents liked their coaches. The children also felt that the won­lost record influenced how much their coaches liked them. It appears that, even at very young ages, children begin to tune in to the adult emphasis on winning, even though they do not yet share it themselves. What children do share is a desire to have fun!",2,3,train
"The debates between social and cultural anthropologists concern not the differences between the concepts but the analytical priority: which should come first, the social chicken or the cultural egg? British anthropology emphasizes the social. It assumes that social institutions determine culture and that universal domains of society (such as kinship, economy, politics, and religion) are represented by specific institutions (such as the family, subsistence farming, the British Parliament, and the Church of England) which can be compared cross-culturally. American anthropology emphasizes the cultural. It assumes that culture shapes social institutions by providing the shared beliefs, the core values, the communicative tools, and so on that make social life possible. It does not assume that there are universal social domains, preferring instead to discover domains empirically as aspects of each society’s own classificatory schemes ― in other words, its culture. And it rejects the notion that any social institution can be understood in isolation from its own context.",2,3,train
"Education, at its best, teaches more than just knowledge. It teaches critical thinking: the ability to stop and think before acting, to avoid succumbing to emotional pressures. This is not thought control. It is the very reverse: mental liberation. Even the most advanced intellectual will be imperfect at this skill. But even imperfect possession of it frees a person from the burden of being ‘stimulus-driven’, constantly reacting to the immediate environment, the brightest colours or loudest sounds. Being driven by heuristic responses, living by instinct and emotion all the time, is a very easy way to live, in many ways: thought is effortful, especially for the inexperienced. But emotions are also exhausting, and short-term reactions may not, in the long term, be the most beneficial for health and survival. Just as we reach for burgers for the sake of convenience, storing up the arterial fat which may one day kill us, so our reliance on feelings can do us great harm.",3,3,train
"The growth of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines, such as art history or palaeontology, and of particular figures such as the art critic, helped produce principles and practices for selecting and organizing what was worthy of keeping, though it remained a struggle. Moreover, as museums and universities drew further apart toward the end of the nineteenth century, and as the idea of objects as a highly valued route to knowing the world went into decline, collecting began to lose its status as a worthy intellectual pursuit, especially in the sciences. The really interesting and important aspects of science were increasingly those invisible to the naked eye, and the classification of things collected no longer promised to produce cutting-edge knowledge. The term “butterfly collecting” could come to be used with the adjective “mere” to indicate a pursuit of secondary academic status.",3,3,train
"People have always needed to eat, and they always will. Rising emphasis on self-expression values does not put an end to material desires. But prevailing economic orientations are gradually being reshaped. People who work in the knowledge sector continue to seek high salaries, but they place equal or greater emphasis on doing stimulating work and being able to follow their own time schedules. Consumption is becoming progressively less determined by the need for sustenance and the practical use of the goods consumed. People still eat, but a growing component of food’s value is determined by its nonmaterial aspects. People pay a premium to eat exotic cuisines that provide an interesting experience or that symbolize a distinctive life-style. The publics of postindustrial societies place growing emphasis on “political consumerism,” such as boycotting goods whose production violates ecological or ethical standards. Consumption is less and less a matter of sustenance and more and more a question of life-style―and choice.",2,3,train
"The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term “multitasking” didn’t exist until the 1960s. It was used to describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer’s ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they probably made a poor choice, for the expression “multitasking” is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It was a clever turn of phrase that’s misleading, for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When they “multitask,” they switch back and forth, alternating their attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which computers tackle multiple tasks that feeds the illusion everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers to humans can be confusing.",2,3,train
"One vivid example of how a market mindset can transform and undermine an institution is given by Dan Ariely in his book Predictably Irrational. He tells the story of a day care center in Israel that decided to fine parents who arrived late to pick up their children, in the hope that this would discourage them from doing so. In fact, the exact opposite happened. Before the imposition of fines, parents felt guilty about arriving late, and guilt was effective in ensuring that only a few did so. Once a fine was introduced, it seems that in the minds of the parents the entire scenario was changed from a social contract to a market one. Essentially, they were paying for the center to look after their children after hours. Some parents thought it worth the price, and the rate of late arrivals increased. Significantly, once the center abandoned the fines and went back to the previous arrangement, late arrivals remained at the high level they had reached during the period of the fines.",5,2,train
"Negative numbers are a lot more abstract than positive numbers—you can’t see negative 4 cookies and you certainly can’t eat them—but you can think about them, and you have to, in all aspects of daily life, from debts to contending with freezing temperatures and parking garages. Still, many of us haven’t quite made peace with negative numbers. People have invented all sorts of funny little mental strategies to sidestep the dreaded negative sign. On mutual fund statements, losses (negative numbers) are printed in red or stuck in parentheses with no negative sign to be found. The history books tell us that Julius Caesar was born in 100 B.C., not -100. The underground levels in a parking garage often have designations like B1 and B2. Temperatures are one of the few exceptions: folks do say, especially here in Ithaca, New York, that it’s -5 degrees outside, though even then, many prefer to say 5 below zero. There’s something about that negative sign that just looks so unpleasant.",1,2,train
"We are now imposing ourselves on nature, instead of the other way around. Perhaps the clearest way to see this is to look at changes in the biomass—the total worldwide weight—of mammals. A long time ago, all of us humans together probably weighed only about two-thirds as much as all the bison in North America, and less than one-eighth as much as all the elephants in Africa. But in the Industrial Era our population exploded and we killed bison and elephants at industrial scale and in terrible numbers. The balance shifted greatly as a result. At present, we humans weigh more than 350 times as much as all bison and elephants put together. We weigh over ten times more than all the earth’s wild mammals combined. And if we add in all the mammals we’ve domesticated—cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, and so on—the comparison becomes truly ridiculous: we and our tamed animals now represent 97 percent of the earth’s mammalian biomass. This comparison illustrates a fundamental point: instead of being limited by the environment, we learned to shape it to our own ends.",1,2,train
"When children are very young, you first say no to protect them from danger. You say it because you love your child and because you must teach him to protect himself. Just as saying no is a tool to help ensure your child’s physical safety, it also contributes to his emotional security. When you set limits on your child’s behavior, whether it’s telling a five-year-old he can’t hit the baby or telling a teenager he can’t stay out past midnight, you’re letting him know that his actions don’t happen in a vacuum. He is connected to someone(you) who watches and cares what he does. All children need a safe space in which to grow and develop. While it’s a child’s nature to test the limits of that space, by climbing higher, venturing farther, or asking for more of what he wants, it’s also comforting for him to know he is not out there alone.",2,2,train
"Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to bringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of the commons. She pointed out, for instance, that the actors affected by the rules for the use and care of resources must have the right to participate in decisions to change the rules. For that reason, the people who monitor and control the behavior of users should also be users and/or have been given a mandate by all users. This is a significant insight, as it shows that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the problem of the commons coming from a state power in comparison with a local solution for which users assume personal responsibility. Ostrom also emphasizes the importance of democratic decision processes and that all users must be given access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts among themselves. Political institutions at central, regional, and local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations and independently ensure observance.",1,3,train
"Once we own something, we’re far more likely to overvalue it. In a study conducted at Duke University, students who won basketball tickets in an extremely onerous lottery (one that they had to wait in line to enter for more than a day) said they wouldn’t sell their tickets for less than, on average, $2,400. But students who had waited and hadn’t won said they would only pay, on average, $170 per ticket. Once a student owned the tickets, he or she saw them as being worth much more in the market than they were. In another example, during the housing market crash of 2008, a real estate website conducted a survey to see how homeowners felt the crash affected the price of their homes. 92% of respondents, aware of nearby foreclosures, asserted these had hurt the price of homes in their neighborhood. However, when asked about the price of their own home, 62% believed it had increased.",1,2,train
"Research and development for seed improvement has long been a public domain and government activity for the common good. However, private capital started to flow into seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy, creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the seed’s nature: its role as means of production and its role as product. This process gained pace after the invention of hybrid breeding of maize in the late 1920s. Today most maize seed cultivated are hybrids. The companies that sell them are able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers, and the grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and replanting. The combination guarantees that farmers will have to buy more seed from the company each season. In the 1990s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to create a growing market for private seed companies.",1,3,train
"Jeffrey A. Rodgers, a vice president of a big company, was once taught the simple idea of pausing to refresh. It began when Jeff realized that as he drove home from work each evening his mind was still focused on work­related projects. We all know this feeling. We may have left the office physically, but we are very much still there mentally, as our minds get caught in the endless loop of replaying the events of today and worrying about all the things we need to get done the following day. So now, as he gets to the door of his house, he applies what he calls “the pause that refreshes.” He stops for just a moment. He closes his eyes. He breathes in and out once: deeply and slowly. As he exhales, he lets the work issues fall away. This allows him to walk through the front door to his family with more singleness of purpose. It supports the sentiment attributed to Lao Tzu: “In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.”",1,3,train
"At the heart of individualism lies the belief that each individual person constitutes the center of one’s universe. At first glance, this seems to be a view that most people would not openly embrace. We are, after all, frequently told to look out for and care about others. Moreover, no one really likes a person who is obviously self­centered. However, we all have to admit that the tug toward a self­centered life is strong, and this tempts us to hide selfish intentions by using the language of unselfishness. If we are honest, we will admit that many things we claim to do sacrificially or just because they are right are exactly the same actions that bring us personal benefit. With a bit of unbiased examination of our motives, it is hard to deny that we have a strong bias toward our individual interests. Thus, despite what we may say to the contrary, it is not hard to make the case that we are more self­centered than we are willing to admit.",4,3,train

He needs immediate feedback to finish the rest of the sequence successfully.",1,3,train
"Correlations are powerful because the insights they offer are relatively clear. These insights are often covered up when we bring causality back into the picture. For instance, a used-car dealer supplied data to statisticians to predict which of the vehicles available for purchase at an auction were likely to have problems. A correlation analysis showed that orange-colored cars were far less likely to have defects. Even as we read this, we already think about why it might be so: Are orange-colored car owners likely to be car enthusiasts and take better care of their vehicles? Or, is it because orange-colored cars are more noticeable on the road and therefore less likely to be in accidents, so they’re in better condition when resold? Quickly we are caught in a web of competing causal hypotheses. But our attempts to illuminate things this way only make them cloudier. Correlations exist; we can show them mathematically. We can’t easily do the same for causal links. So we would do well to hold off from trying to explain the reason behind the correlations.",5,2,train

"Typically an individual cannot accurately assess the gains and costs likely to occur in social interactions. Even the intrinsic satisfactions associated with the individual’s own behaviors may turn sour if the other person somehow does the wrong thing. For example, a person may derive intrinsic satisfaction from helping others; so if the recipient reciprocates favor for favor, both intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction derive from the profitable interaction. However, the recipient may ignore or even resent the good­intended gesture as patronizing and may verbally abuse the favor doer, thereby increasing the costs, perhaps spoiling the intrinsic satisfaction (gain) of the behavior, and hence leaving the favor doer with a net loss for the interaction. The consequences of interaction can be difficult to foresee because they depend as much on the behavior of others as on oneself.",3,3,train
"We might think that our gut instinct is just an inner feeling —a secret interior voice—but in fact it is shaped by a perception of something visible around us, such as a facial expression or a visual inconsistency so fleeting that often we’re not even aware we’ve noticed it. Psychologists now think of this moment as a ‘visual matching game’. So a stressed, rushed or tired person is more likely to resort to this visual matching. When they see a situation in front of them, they quickly match it to a sea of past experiences stored in a mental knowledge bank and then, based on a match, they assign meaning to the information in front of them. The brain then sends a signal to the gut, which has many hundreds of nerve cells. So the visceral feeling we get in the pit of our stomach and the butterflies we feel are a(n) result of our cognitive processing system.",1,2,train
"Young contemporary artists who employ digital technologies in their practice rarely make reference to computers. For example, Wade Guyton, an abstractionist who uses a word processing program and inkjet printers, does not call himself a computer artist. Moreover, some critics, who admire his work, are little concerned about his extensive use of computers in the art-making process. This is a marked contrast from three decades ago when artists who utilized computers were labeled by critics―often disapprovingly―as computer artists. For the present generation of artists, the computer, or more appropriately, the laptop, is one in a collection of integrated, portable digital technologies that link their social and working life. With tablets and cell phones surpassing personal computers in Internet usage, and as slim digital devices resemble nothing like the room-sized mainframes and bulky desktop computers of previous decades, it now appears that the computer artist is finally extinct.",5,3,train
"When scientists describe tool use by human beings, it is usually in terms of mechanical tools. This may apply to tools such as a sharpened flint blade or an electric drill. The key point is that the tool is thought of as passive and with a small number of predetermined uses. The digital revolution has begun to change this landscape in a significant way. Tools are now being developed with a general function in mind, but they are not predetermined in their operations. As a result, it is not possible to predict the outcome of their use. For example, the personal computer is designed for the general function of handling and processing information, but exactly how the PC is used is not predetermined. Therefore, for some, it may offer a means of communication; for others, a sophisticated means of managing accounts; and for yet others, an entertainment platform.",2,3,train
"Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good reason. The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the end of the 19th century. Unlike the original novel, Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The setting, time period, dialogue and other incidental details are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness. Both describe a physical journey, reflecting the central character’s mental and spiritual journey, down a river to confront the deranged Kurtz character, who represents the worst aspects of civilisation. By giving Apocalypse Now a setting that was contemporary at the time of its release, audiences were able to experience and identify with its themes more easily than they would have if the film had been a literal adaptation of the novel.",1,3,train
"Veblen goods are named after Thorstein Veblen, a US economist who formulated the theory of conspicuous consumption . They are strange because demand for them increases as their price rises. According to Veblen, these goods must signal high status. A willingness to pay higher prices is due to a desire to advertise wealth rather than to acquire better quality. A true Veblen good, therefore, should not be noticeably higher quality than the lower-priced equivalents. If the price falls so much that it is no longer high enough to exclude the less well off, the rich will stop buying it. There is much evidence of this behavior in the markets for luxury cars, champagne, watches, and certain clothing labels. A reduction in prices might see a temporary increase in sales for the seller, but then sales will begin to fall.",5,2,train
"There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. In discharging their usual responsibilities of description and commentary, reporters’ accounts of sports events are eagerly consulted by sports fans, while in their broader journalistic role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are among the most visible of all contemporary writers. The ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do.

Researchers compared the amount of individual talent on teams with the teams’ success, and they found striking examples of more talent hurting the team. The researchers looked at three sports: basketball, soccer, and baseball. In each sport, they calculated both the percentage of top talent on each team and the teams’ success over several years. For both basketball and soccer, they found that top talent did in fact predict team success, but only up to a point. Furthermore, there was not simply a point of diminishing returns with respect to top talent; there was in fact a cost. Basketball and soccer teams with the greatest proportion of elite athletes performed worse than those with more moderate proportions of top level players.",1,3,train
"In A Theory of Adaptation, Linda Hutcheon argues that “An adaptation is not vampiric: it does not draw the life­blood from its source and leave it dying or dead, nor is it paler than the adapted work. It may, on the contrary, keep that prior work alive, giving it an afterlife it would never have had otherwise.” Hutcheon’s refusal to see adaptation as “vampiric” is particularly inspiring for those of us who do work on adaptations. The idea of an “afterlife” of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works “alive.” Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present—functioning as both “monuments” to history and the “flesh” of the reader’s lived experience. While this is true for adaptations in general, it is especially important for those written with young adults in mind. Such adaptations allow young readers to make personal connections with texts that might otherwise come across as old­fashioned or irrelevant.",1,3,train
"In the 20th century, average life expectancy in the United States rose by nearly 30 years. The vast majority of that increase is credited to advances in public health, rather than advances in medical care, and legal interventions played a critical role in these advances. For example, requirements that children be vaccinated before they attend school played a central role in reducing occurrence of vaccine­preventable diseases. Smallpox and polio, which were once feared and deadly diseases, were eliminated from the Western Hemisphere (with smallpox eliminated worldwide), while the number of new measles cases dropped from more than 300,000 in 1950 to fewer than 100 in 2000. Likewise, following the introduction of extensive vehicle and roadway safety laws starting in the mid­1960s, the number of highway deaths decreased from roughly 51,000 in 1966 to 42,000 in 2000, even as the number of miles driven per year increased nearly 300%.",5,3,train

"One of the primary ways by which music is able to take on significance in our inner world is by the way it interacts with memory. Memories associated with important emotions tend to be more deeply embedded in our memory than other events. Emotional memories are more likely to be vividly remembered and are more likely to be recalled with the passing of time than neutral memories. Since music can be extremely emotionally evocative, key life events can be emotionally heightened by the presence of music, ensuring that memories of the event become deeply encoded. Retrieval of those memories is then enhanced by contextual effects, in which a recreation of a similar context to that in which the memories were encoded can facilitate their retrieval. Thus, re-hearing the same music associated with the event can activate intensely vivid memories of the event.",3,2,train
"One of the key contributions of critical theorists concerns the production of knowledge. Given that the transmission of knowledge is an integral activity in schools, critical scholars in the field of education have been especially concerned with how knowledge is produced. The scholars argue that a key element of social injustice involves the claim that particular knowledge is objective, neutral, and universal. An approach based on critical theory calls into question the idea that objectivity is desirable or even possible. The term used to describe this way of thinking about knowledge is that knowledge is socially constructed. When we refer to knowledge as socially constructed we mean that knowledge is reflective of the values and interests of those who produce it. This concept captures the understanding that all knowledge and all means of knowing are connected to a social context.",2,3,train
"If one looks at the Oxford definition, one gets the sense that post-truth is not so much a claim that truth does not exist as that facts are subordinate to our political point of view. The Oxford definition focuses on “what” post-truth is: the idea that feelings sometimes matter more than facts. But just as important is the next question, which is why this ever occurs. Someone does not argue against an obvious or easily confirmable fact for no reason; he or she does so when it is to his or her advantage. When a person’s beliefs are threatened by an “inconvenient fact,” sometimes it is preferable to challenge the fact. This can happen at either a conscious or unconscious level (since sometimes the person we are seeking to convince is ourselves), but the point is that this sort of post-truth relationship to facts occurs only when we are seeking to assert something that is more important to us than the truth itself.",5,3,train
"Centralized, formal rules can facilitate productive activity by establishing roles and practices. The rules of baseball don’t just regulate the behavior of the players; they determine the behavior that constitutes playing the game. Rules do not prevent people from playing baseball; they create the very practice that allows people to play baseball. A score of music imposes rules, but it also creates a pattern of conduct that enables people to produce music. Legal rules that enable the formation of corporations, that enable the use of wills and trusts, that create negotiable instruments, and that establish the practice of contracting all make practices that create new opportunities for individuals. And we have legal rules that establish roles individuals play within the legal system, such as judges, trustees, partners, and guardians. True, the legal rules that establish these roles constrain the behavior of individuals who occupy them, but rules also create the roles themselves. Without them an individual would not have the opportunity to occupy the role.",5,3,train
"When examining the archaeological record of human culture, one has to consider that it is vastly incomplete. Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems.",3,3,train

When you are telling an employee, lawn service worker, your teenager, or anyone else, what it is that you want them to do, you may just have to repeat the order and instructions several times before the receiver really gets what it is you want done. That’s not bad. That’s normal communication lag. Be patient. When you are asking someone a question, in an effort to learn a fact that you feel is important for you to know, but they just don’t seem to be willing to give you an answer, take it as a signal that you need to rephrase your question a little and repeat it again, and again, and again, until finally you are heard and answered.",1,3,train
"A distinct emotional trait of human nature is to watch fellow humans closely, to learn their stories, and thereby to judge their character and dependability. And so it has ever been since the Pleistocene. The first bands classifiable to the genus Homo and their descendants were hunter­gatherers. Like the Kalahari Ju/’hoansi of today, they almost certainly depended on sophisticated cooperative behavior just to survive from one day to the next. That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others. It gives deep satisfaction—call it, if you will, a human instinct—not just to learn but also to share emotions stirred by the stories told by our companions. The whole of these performances pays off in survival and reproduction. Gossip and storytelling are Darwinian phenomena.",1,3,train
"Many people create and share pictures and videos on the Internet. The difficulty is finding what you want. Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward―we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image. It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street.",2,3,train
"Some people have defined wildlife damage management as the science and management of overabundant species, but this definition is too narrow. All wildlife species act in ways that harm human interests. Thus, all species cause wildlife damage, not just overabundant ones. One interesting example of this involves endangered peregrine falcons in California, which prey on another endangered species, the California least tern. Certainly, we would not consider peregrine falcons as being overabundant, but we wish that they would not feed on an endangered species. In this case, one of the negative values associated with a peregrine falcon population is that its predation reduces the population of another endangered species. The goal of wildlife damage management in this case would be to stop the falcons from eating the terns without harming the falcons.",2,3,train
"Because the environment plays a significant role in aiding meaningful internal processes, subjective experience and the environment act as a ‘coupled system.’ This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own. In this manner, subjective experience is extended into the external environment and vice versa; the external environment with its disciplinary objects such as institutional laws and equipment becomes mental institutions that affect our subjective experience and solutions. A subjectively held belief attains the status of objectivity when the belief is socially shared. That is, even if we are trained as hard-nosed health care rationalists, or no-nonsense bureaucrats, or data-driven scientists, research has shown that our decisions are influenced by various institutional practices. They include bureaucratic structures and procedures, the architectural design of health care institutions, the rules of evidence and the structure of allowable questions in a courtroom trial, the spatial arrangement of kindergartens and supermarkets, and a variety of conventions and practices designed to manipulate our emotions.",1,3,train
"In one of the most famous passages of Being and Nothingness, “The Look,” Jean­Paul Sartre describes the peculiar vulnerability that develops when someone goes from seeing (being a self with a perspective on the world) to being seen (having to confront the perspective of another on one’s self). He illustrates it with the example of someone looking through a keyhole who suddenly finds himself caught by someone watching him. The look of the other is always unnerving, Sartre argues, not only because we momentarily recognize ourselves in it through our imagination of their judgment of us but also because we don’t. We can always step back, challenge our perception of others’ perceptions of ourselves, or explain them away—but we don’t know what these perceptions really are. Others have the distinctive power of making us feel judged in ways we cannot fully control. Social life is all about the fear that accompanies our awareness that we can never access what the other sees. We can only guess.",1,3,train
"Over the past 60 years, as mechanical processes have replicated behaviors and talents we thought were unique to humans, we’ve had to change our minds about what sets us apart. As we invent more species of AI, we will be forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique about humans. Each step of surrender ─ we are not the only mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent a mathematical law ─ will be painful and sad. We’ll spend the next three decades ─ indeed, perhaps the next century ─ in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for. If we aren’t unique toolmakers, or artists, or moral ethicists, then what, if anything, makes us special? In the grandest irony of all, the greatest benefit of an everyday, utilitarian AI will not be increased productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of doing science ─ although all those will happen. The greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity.",1,3,train
"No learning is possible without an error signal. Organisms only learn when events violate their expectations. In other words, surprise is one of the fundamental drivers of learning. Imagine hearing a series of identical notes, AAAAA. Each note draws out a response in the auditory areas of your brain—but as the notes repeat, those responses progressively decrease. This is called “adaptation,” a deceptively simple phenomenon that shows that your brain is learning to anticipate the next event. Suddenly, the note changes: AAAAA#. Your primary auditory cortex immediately shows a strong surprise reaction: not only does the adaptation fade away, but additional neurons begin to vigorously fire in response to the unexpected sound. And it is not just repetition that leads to adaptation: what matters is whether the notes are predictable. For instance, if you hear an alternating set of notes, such as ABABA, your brain gets used to this alternation, and the activity in your auditory areas again decreases. This time, however, it is an unexpected repetition, such as ABABB, that triggers a surprise response.",2,2,train
"News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not only by its choice of topics and stories but by its verbal and visual idioms or modes of address. Presentational styles have been subject to a tension between an informational-educational purpose and the need to engage us entertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often ‘serious’ in tone sticking to the ‘rules’ of balance, more popular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which we are invited to consider the impact of particular news items from the perspective of the ‘average person in the street’. Indeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an increased use of faster editing tempos and ‘flashier’ presentational styles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts and the ‘star quality’ of news readers. Popular formats can be said to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling to endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats. However, they arguably work to reduce understanding by failing to provide the structural contexts for news events.",5,3,train
"Temporal resolution is particularly interesting in the context of satellite remote sensing. The temporal density of remotely sensed imagery is large, impressive, and growing. Satellites are collecting a great deal of imagery as you read this sentence. However, most applications in geography and environmental studies do not require extremely fine-grained temporal resolution. Meteorologists may require visible, infrared, and radar information at sub-hourly temporal resolution; urban planners might require imagery at monthly or annual resolution; and transportation planners may not need any time series information at all for some applications. Again, the temporal resolution of imagery used should meet the requirements of your inquiry. Sometimes researchers have to search archives of aerial photographs to get information from that past that pre-date the collection of satellite imagery.",2,3,train
"One of the common themes of the Western philosophical tradition is the distinction between sensual perceptions and rational knowledge. Since Plato, the supremacy of rational reason is based on the assertion that it is able to extract true knowledge from experience. As the discussion in the Republic helps to explain, perceptions are inherently unreliable and misleading because the senses are subject to errors and illusions. Only the rational discourse has the tools to overcome illusions and to point towards true knowledge. For instance, perception suggests that a figure in the distance is smaller than it really is. Yet, the application of logical reasoning will reveal that the figure only appears small because it obeys the laws of geometrical perspective. Nevertheless, even after the perspectival correction is applied and reason concludes that perception is misleading, the figure still appears small, and the truth of the matter is revealed not in the perception of the figure but in its rational representation.",5,3,train
"When it comes to climates in the interior areas of continents, mountains play a huge role in stopping the flow of moisture. A great example of this can be seen along the West Coast of the United States. Air moving from the Pacific Ocean toward the land usually has a great deal of moisture in it. When this humid air moves across the land, it encounters the Coast Range Mountains. As the air moves up and over the mountains, it begins to cool, which causes precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. Once the air moves down the opposite side of the mountains (called the leeward side) it has lost a great deal of moisture. The air continues to move and then hits the even higher Sierra Nevada mountain range. This second uplift causes most of the remaining moisture to fall out of the air, so by the time it reaches the leeward side of the Sierras, the air is extremely dry. The result is that much of the state of Nevada is a desert.",3,2,train
"Emma Brindley has investigated the responses of European robins to the songs of neighbors and strangers. Despite the large and complex song repertoire of European robins, they were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers. When they heard a tape recording of a stranger, they began to sing sooner, sang more songs, and overlapped their songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a neighbor’s song. As Brindley suggests, the overlapping of song may be an aggressive response. However, this difference in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when the neighbor’s song was played by a loudspeaker placed at the boundary between that neighbor’s territory and the territory of the bird being tested. If the same neighbor’s song was played at another boundary, one separating the territory of the test subject from another neighbor, it was treated as the call of a stranger. Not only does this result demonstrate that the robins associate locality with familiar songs, but it also shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments is highly important.",4,3,train
"Even if it is correct to say that we express and represent our thoughts in language, it may be a big mistake to suppose that there are structural similarities between what is doing the representing and what is represented. Robert Stalnaker, in his book Inquiry, suggests an analogy with the representation of numbers: The number 9 can be represented as ‘12—3’ but it does not follow that 12, 3, or subtraction are constituents of the number 9. We could compare a thought and its verbal expression with toothpaste and its ‘expression’ from a tube. That the result of expressing toothpaste is a long, thin, cylinder does not entail that toothpaste itself is long, thin, or cylindrical. Similarly, a thought might get expressed out loud in a statement with a particular linguistic structure. It does not follow that the thought itself has such a structure. Suppose, for example, that I look at a fruit bowl, and think that there is an apple and an orange in that bowl. The objects in front of my eyes include some pieces of fruit and a bowl, but no object corresponding to the word ‘and’ exists either in the world or in my visual image.",1,3,train
"When the navigation app on your smartphone is telling you the best route to the airport based on current traffic patterns, how does it know where the traffic is? Navigation systems are tracking your cell phone and the cell phones of thousands of other users of the applications to see how quickly those cell phones move through traffic. If you’re stuck in a traffic jam, your cell phone reports the same GPS coordinates for several minutes; if traffic is moving swiftly, your cell phone moves as quickly as your car and these apps can recommend routes based on that. The quality of the overall system depends crucially on there being a large number of users. In this respect they’re similar to telephones, fax machines, and e­mail: If only one or two people have them, they are not much good―their utility increases with the number of users.",2,3,train
"Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective material artefacts, mythologies, memories and traditions become resources for the present. The contents, interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present; an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future. It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present. Further, heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts. It is the former that give value, either cultural or financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past. In turn, they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even, as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents. Thus heritage is as much about forgetting as remembering the past.",2,3,train
"Life is insecure and human well­being is fragile. If we are honest with ourselves, we realize that, despite our best efforts, we often cannot control the vicissitudes of human existence. We go through life in fear and trembling, fearing what may happen, while hoping for the best. Most of us get anxious in the face of an indeterminate or ambiguous situation. We don’t handle uncertainty very well. We are easily tempted to settle for quick “solutions,” in order to eliminate our anxiety and doubt, even though these quick fixes may not, in the long run, actually be adequate solutions. It is natural, therefore, and even somewhat necessary, for us to seek stability in a sea of change and indeterminacy. We want a fixed star to guide us on our journey through hazardous waters. If only we could have knowledge of what is fixed, unchanging, and ultimately reliable, then, we assume, that would be knowledge most worth having.",2,3,train
"The quest for knowledge in the material world is a never­ending pursuit, but the quest does not mean that a thoroughly schooled person is an educated person or that an educated person is a wise person. We are too often blinded by our ignorance of our ignorance, and our pursuit of knowledge is no guarantee of wisdom. Hence, we are prone to becoming the blind leading the blind because our overemphasis on competition in nearly everything makes looking good more important than being good. The resultant fear of being thought a fool and criticized therefore is one of greatest enemies of true learning. Although our ignorance is undeniably vast, it is from the vastness of this selfsame ignorance that our sense of wonder grows. But, when we do not know we are ignorant, we do not know enough to even question, let alone investigate, our ignorance. No one can teach another person anything. All one can do with and for someone else is to facilitate learning by helping the person to discover the wonder of their ignorance.",5,3,train
"People have always wanted to be around other people and to learn from them. Cities have long been dynamos of social possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you prefer, “lexical innovation,” has always started in cities―an outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans- missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then language innovation would happen where the most people heard and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change because they offer the greatest exposure to other people, who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem to attract. Media, ever more global, ever more far-reaching, spread language faster to more people.",2,3,train
"Weber’s law concerns the perception of difference between two stimuli. It suggests that we might not be able to detect a 1-mm difference when we are looking at lines 466 mm and 467 mm in length, but we may be able to detect a 1-mm difference when we are comparing a line 2 mm long with one 3 mm long. Another example of this principle is that we can detect 1 candle when it is lit in an otherwise dark room. But when 1 candle is lit in a room in which 100 candles are already burning, we may not notice the light from this candle. Therefore, the Just-noticeable difference (JND) varies as a function of the strength of the signals. For example, the JND is greater for very loud noises than it is for much more quiet sounds. When a sound is very weak, we can tell that another sound is louder, even if it is barely louder. When a sound is very loud, to tell that another sound is even louder, it has to be much louder. Thus, Weber’s law means that it is harder to distinguish between two samples when those samples are larger or stronger levels of the stimuli.",4,2,train
"Sculpture in a public place is the emotional and aesthetic focal point of the elements in the surrounding environment. Any environment is unique with the diversity of its component elements, the connections between them and their appearance as a complete structure. This preliminary structural analysis and acquaintance with the site chosen for the sculpture is compulsory before working on its design; it is a requirement for successful integration in the specific space. The proper understanding of the spatial characteristics of the elements, making up the whole multitude, as well as of the structural links between the constituent elements of this specific microcosm are preconditions for satisfactory design and an adequate sculptural solution. Contrary to the mechanical adding of one more element to the multitude, it is better to “weave” something more into the context of the existing structure.",1,3,train
"Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over time. The negative version instructs restraint; the positive encourages intervention. One sets a baseline of at least not causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized beneficent behavior. While examples of these rules abound, too many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and “Love another as yourself.” Both versions insist on caring for others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or through acts of commission, by actively intervening. Yet while these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, they do not require abandoning self-concern altogether. The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego nonetheless remains partly self-referential. Both the negative and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated.",4,3,train
"The Neanderthals would have faced a problem when it was daylight: the light quality is much poorer at high latitudes and this would have meant that they couldn’t see things in the distance so well. For a hunter, this is a serious problem, because you really don’t want to make the mistake of not noticing the mother rhinoceros hiding in a dark corner of the forest edge when trying to spear her calf. Living under low light conditions places a much heavier premium on vision than most researchers imagine. The evolutionary response to low light levels is to increase the size of the visual processing system. It is the familiar principle from conventional star-gazing telescopes: under the dim lighting of the night sky, a larger mirror allows you to gather more of the light from whatever you want to look at. By the same token, a larger retina allows you to receive more light to compensate for poor light levels.",3,2,train
"In an increasingly globalized world, literature in translation has an especially important role. Increasingly, writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab societies. This growing interest is, in turn, driving a boom in translation. However, not surprisingly perhaps, most translations are from English into other languages, not from another language, such as Arabic, into English. Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the imbalance. Bookstores in the United States, for example, rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid-20th century. Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s more experimental work, his political and religious allegories, or his historical dramas.

"The history of perspective in Western painting matters because of what it reveals for the art of living. Just as most artists conform to the stylistic conventions of the era into which they are born, we similarly conform to prevailing social conventions about how to live. These unwritten rules typically include getting married and having children, owning your own home and having a mortgage, having a regular job and commuting to work, and flying abroad for holidays. For some people these are realities, for others they remain aspirations. It is common to feel social pressure to comply with them. At this point in Western history, they are amongst the dominant conventions that most of us have accepted with little questioning, much as Vermeer and other Dutch baroque painters of the seventeenth century accepted linear perspective without question. It is difficult to see beyond the limitations of the culture that has shaped our ways of looking at the world and at ourselves. We are trapped in the perspective of our own time.",2,3,train
"Epictetus wrote, “A man’s master is he who is able to confirm or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns.” If you depend on no one except yourself to satisfy your desires, you will have no master other than yourself and you will be free. Stoic philosophy was about that―taking charge of your life, learning to work on those things that are within your power to accomplish or change and not to waste energy on things you cannot. In particular, the Stoics warned against reacting emotionally to what is outside your control. Often, Epictetus argued, it’s not our circumstances that get us down but rather the judgments we make about them. Consider anger. We don’t get angry at the rain if it spoils our picnic. That would be silly because we can’t do anything about the rain. But we often do get angry if someone mistreats us. We usually can’t control or change that person any more than we can stop the rain, so that is equally silly. More generally, it is just as pointless to tie our feelings of well­being to altering another individual’s behavior as it is to tie them to the weather. Epictetus wrote, “If it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.”",3,3,train
"There have been psychological studies in which subjects were shown photographs of people’s faces and asked to identify the expression or state of mind evinced. The results are invariably very mixed. In the 17th century the French painter and theorist Charles Le Brun drew a series of faces illustrating the various emotions that painters could be called upon to represent. What is striking about them is that any number of them could be substituted for one another without loss. What is missing in all this is any setting or context to make the emotion determinate. We must know who this person is, who these other people are, what their relationship is, what is at stake in the scene, and the like. In real life as well as in painting we do not come across just faces; we encounter people in particular situations and our understanding of people cannot somehow be precipitated and held isolated from the social and human circumstances in which they, and we, live and breathe and have our being.",5,3,train
"The entrance to a honeybee colony, often referred to as the dancefloor, is a market place for information about the state of the colony and the environment outside the hive. Studying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a number of illustrative examples of how individuals changing their own behavior in response to local information allow the colony to regulate its workforce. For example, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s need.",1,3,train
"Modern psychological theory states that the process of understanding is a matter of construction, not reproduction, which means that the process of understanding takes the form of the interpretation of data coming from the outside and generated by our mind. For example, the perception of a moving object as a car is based on an interpretation of incoming data within the framework of our knowledge of the world. While the interpretation of simple objects is usually an uncontrolled process, the interpretation of more complex phenomena, such as interpersonal situations, usually requires active attention and thought. Psychological studies indicate that it is knowledge possessed by the individual that determines which stimuli become the focus of that individual’s attention, what significance he or she assigns to these stimuli, and how they are combined into a larger whole. This subjective world, interpreted in a particular way, is for us the “objective” world; we cannot know any world other than the one we know as a result of our own interpretations.",2,3,train
"Fans feel for feeling’s own sake. They make meanings beyond what seems to be on offer. They build identities and experiences, and make artistic creations of their own to share with others. A person can be an individual fan, feeling an “idealized connection with a star, strong feelings of memory and nostalgia,” and engaging in activities like “collecting to develop a sense of self.” But, more often, individual experiences are embedded in social contexts where other people with shared attachments socialize around the object of their affections. Much of the pleasure of fandom comes from being connected to other fans. In their diaries, Bostonians of the 1800s described being part of the crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance. A compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less the object of their fandom than the attachments to (and differentiations from) one another that those affections afford.",4,3,train
"In the post-World War II years after 1945, unparalleled economic growth fueled a building boom and a massive migration from the central cities to the new suburban areas. The suburbs were far more dependent on the automobile, signaling the shift from primary dependence on public transportation to private cars. Soon this led to the construction of better highways and freeways and the decline and even loss of public transportation. With all of these changes came a privatization of leisure. As more people owned their own homes, with more space inside and lovely yards outside, their recreation and leisure time was increasingly centered around the home or, at most, the neighborhood. One major activity of this home-based leisure was watching television. No longer did one have to ride the trolly to the theater to watch a movie; similar entertainment was available for free and more conveniently from television.",4,3,train
"Scaling up from the small to the large is often accompanied by an evolution from simplicity to complexity while maintaining basic elements unchanged or conserved. This is familiar in engineering, economics, companies, cities, organisms, and, perhaps most dramatically, evolutionary process. For example, a skyscraper in a large city is a significantly more complex object than a modest family dwelling in a small town, but the underlying principles of construction and design, including questions of mechanics, energy and information distribution, the size of electrical outlets, water faucets, telephones, laptops, doors, etc., all remain approximately the same independent of the size of the building. Similarly, organisms have evolved to have an enormous range of sizes and an extraordinary diversity of morphologies and interactions, which often reflect increasing complexity, yet fundamental building blocks like cells, mitochondria, capillaries, and even leaves do not appreciably change with body size or increasing complexity of the class of systems in which they are embedded.",1,3,train
"Some of the most insightful work on information seeking emphasizes “strategic self-ignorance,” understood as “the use of ignorance as an excuse to engage excessively in pleasurable activities that may be harmful to one’s future self.” The idea here is that if people are present-biased, they might avoid information that would make current activities less attractive ―perhaps because it would produce guilt or shame, perhaps because it would suggest an aggregate trade-off that would counsel against engaging in such activities. St. Augustine famously said, “God give me chastity―tomorrow.” Present-biased agents think: “Please let me know the risks―tomorrow.” Whenever people are thinking about engaging in an activity with short-term benefits but long-term costs, they might prefer to delay receipt of important information. The same point might hold about information that could make people sad or mad: “Please tell me what I need to know―tomorrow.”",2,3,train
"Whatever their differences, scientists and artists begin with the same question: can you and I see the same thing the same way? If so, how? The scientific thinker looks for features of the thing that can be stripped of subjectivity―ideally, those aspects that can be quantified and whose values will thus never change from one observer to the next. In this way, he arrives at a reality independent of all observers. The artist, on the other hand, relies on the strength of her artistry to effect a marriage between her own subjectivity and that of her readers. To a scientific thinker, this must sound like magical thinking: you’re saying you will imagine something so hard it’ll pop into someone else’s head exactly the way you envision it? The artist has sought the opposite of the scientist’s observer-independent reality. She creates a reality dependent upon observers, indeed a reality in which human beings must participate in order for it to exist at all.",1,3,train
"Investigators as a personality type place a high value on science, process, and learning. They excel at research, using logic and the information gained through their senses to conquer complex problems. Nothing thrills them more than a “big find.” Intellectual, introspective, and exceedingly detail-oriented, investigators are happiest when they’re using their brain power to pursue what they deem as a worthy outcome. They prefer to march to their own beat, and they dislike overly structured environments that necessitate a set response to challenges. Investigators are not interested in leadership, and developing the interpersonal skills necessary to fuel collaboration is a hurdle for many of them. They may feel insecure in their ability to “keep up” in their fields and can react badly when forced to put more important work on hold to complete a task that doesn’t intrigue them.",2,3,train
"Audiences appreciate aha moments so much that they also enjoy simply expecting them, even if the moment never comes. Somebody can enjoy a long book or television show that offers no answer for hours and hours if the genre itself promises a resolution. When the popular, mystic television show Lost ended, many fans erupted in indignation that the showrunners failed to resolve the series’ many puzzles. This deprived careful viewers of the final aha moment that they thought they’d been promised. Some people surely felt like they’d wasted weeks, even months, of their lives waiting for answers. But their final disappointment didn’t retroactively change the sincere thrill they’d felt throughout the series. Lost was a monster hit for many years because audiences enjoyed the experience of anticipating answers, even though the writers were just stockpiling riddles without resolutions. Many people will put themselves through quite a bit of anguish if they expect fluent resolution at the end.",4,3,train
"Science and technology degrees are rewarding because they are not designed exclusively to get you into a job and keep you there. If you are taking a highly specialized or vocational degree, you may well know what career you are aiming for even before you get to university, but for most science and technology undergraduates university is an adventure in itself; ideas about a career may be in your thoughts, but not completely fixed. This gives you the advantage of knowing that you can develop your career ideas as your course progresses, aware that your degree will be of help to you in many areas of work. It is perhaps with this in mind that science and technology degree programs tend to be wide in scope and flexible in approach. You might go to university to study chemistry and find yourself doing some work within the physics department.",5,3,train
"The human species is unique in its ability to expand its functionality by inventing new cultural tools. Writing, arithmetic, science ― all are recent inventions. Our brains did not have enough time to evolve for them, but I reason that they were made possible because we can mobilize our old areas in novel ways. When we learn to read, we recycle a specific region of our visual system known as the visual word-form area, enabling us to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language areas. Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities ― a fast connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity area. Even an invention as elementary as finger-counting changes our cognitive abilities dramatically. Amazonian people who have not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as simple as, say, 6—2. This “cultural recycling” implies that the functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex mixture of biological and cultural constraints.",2,3,train
"The connectedness of the global economic market makes it vulnerable to potential “infection.” A financial failure can make its way from borrowers to banks to insurers, spreading like a flu. However, there are unexpected characteristics when it comes to such infection in the market. Infection can occur even without any contact. A bank might become insolvent even without having any of its investments fail. Fear and uncertainty can be damaging to financial markets, just as cascading failures due to bad investments. If we all woke up tomorrow and believed that Bank X would be insolvent, then it would become insolvent. In fact, it would be enough for us to fear that others believed that Bank X was going to fail, or just to fear our collective fear! We might all even know that Bank X was well-managed with healthy investments, but if we expected others to pull their money out, then we would fear being the last to pull our money out. Financial distress can be self-fulfilling and is a particularly troublesome aspect of financial markets.",1,2,train
"More than just having territories, animals also partition them. And this insight turned out to be particularly useful for zoo husbandry. An animal’s territory has an internal arrangement that Heini Hediger compared to the inside of a person’s house. Most of us assign separate functions to separate rooms, but even if you look at a one-room house you will find the same internal specialization. In a cabin or a mud hut, or even a Mesolithic cave from 30,000 years ago, this part is for cooking, that part is for sleeping; this part is for making tools and weaving, that part is for waste. We keep a neat functional organization. To a varying extent, other animals do the same. A part of an animal’s territory is for eating, a part for sleeping, a part for swimming or wallowing, a part may be set aside for waste, depending on the species of animal.",2,3,train
"Manufacturers design their innovation processes around the way they think the process works. The vast majority of manufacturers still think that product development and service development are always done by manufacturers, and that their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that lead users have already developed. Accordingly, manufacturers have set up market-research departments to explore the needs of users in the target market, product-development groups to think up suitable products to address those needs, and so forth. The needs and prototype solutions of lead users―if encountered at all―are typically rejected as outliers of no interest. Indeed, when lead users’ innovations do enter a firm’s product line―and they have been shown to be the actual source of many major innovations for many firms―they typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic route.",2,3,train
"Food unites as well as distinguishes eaters because what and how one eats forms much of one’s emotional tie to a group identity, be it a nation or an ethnicity. The famous twentieth-century Chinese poet and scholar Lin Yutang remarks, “Our love for fatherland is largely a matter of recollection of the keen sensual pleasure of our childhood. The loyalty to Uncle Sam is the loyalty to American doughnuts, and the loyalty to the Vaterland is the loyalty to Pfannkuchen and Stollen.” Such keen connection between food and national or ethnic identification clearly indicates the truth that cuisine and table narrative occupy a significant place in the training grounds of a community and its civilization, and thus, eating, cooking, and talking about one’s cuisine are vital to a community’s wholeness and continuation. In other words, the destiny of a community depends on how well it nourishes its members.",4,3,train
"The audience receives a sound signal entirely through the vibrations generated in the air, whereas in a singer some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear through the singer’s own bones. Since these two ways of transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies at various frequencies, the overall quality of the sound will be quite different. You have probably experienced this when you have listened to your own voice, as on tape or through a public address system. It is easy to blame the ‘sound of a stranger’ on ‘poor electronics,’ but this is only partly justified. The major effect comes from the fact that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear you. This is one of the main reasons why even the most accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of coaches and voice teachers as to ‘how they sound,’ whereas no concert violinist would have to do such a thing. To the violinist playing sounds almost exactly the same as it does to someone else standing nearby.",4,3,train
"Everyone who drives, walks, or swipes a transit card in a city views herself as a transportation expert from the moment she walks out the front door. And how she views the street tracks pretty closely with how she gets around. That’s why we find so many well-intentioned and civic-minded citizens arguing past one another. At neighborhood meetings in school auditoriums, and in back rooms at libraries and churches, local residents across the nation gather for often-contentious discussions about transportation proposals that would change a city’s streets. And like all politics, all transportation is local and intensely personal. A transit project that could speed travel for tens of thousands of people can be stopped by objections to the loss of a few parking spaces or by the simple fear that the project won’t work. It’s not a challenge of the data or the traffic engineering or the planning. Public debates about streets are typically rooted in emotional assumptions about how a change will affect a person’s commute, ability to park, belief about what is safe and what isn’t, or the bottom line of a local business.",4,3,train
"Thomas Edison was indeed a creative genius, but it was not until he discovered some of the principles of marketing that he found increased success. One of his first inventions was, although much needed, a failure. In 1869, he created and patented an electronic vote recorder, which recorded and totalled the votes in the Massachusetts state legislature faster than the chamber’s old manual system. To Edison’s astonishment, it failed. Edison had not taken into account legislators’ habits. They didn’t like to vote quickly and efficiently. They liked to lobby their fellow legislators as voting took place. Edison had a great idea, but he completely misunderstood the needs of his customers. He learned from his failure the relationship between invention and marketing. Edison learned that marketing and invention must be integrated. “Anything that won’t sell, I don’t want to invent,” he said. “Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.” He realized he needed to put the customers’ needs first and tailor his thinking accordingly.",5,2,train
"Attitude has been conceptualized into four main components: affective (feelings of liking or disliking), cognitive (beliefs and evaluation of those beliefs), behavioral intention (a statement of how one would behave in a certain situation), and behavior. Public attitudes toward a wildlife species and its management are generated based on the interaction of those components. In forming our attitudes toward wolves, people strive to keep their affective components of attitude consistent with their cognitive component. For example, I could dislike wolves; I believe they have killed people (cognitive belief), and having people killed is of course bad (evaluation of belief). The behavioral intention that could result from this is to support a wolf control program and actual behavior may be a history of shooting wolves. In this example, all aspects of attitude are consistent with each other, producing a negative overall attitude toward wolves.",2,2,train
"The role of science can sometimes be overstated, with its advocates slipping into scientism. Scientism is the view that the scientific description of reality is the only truth there is. With the advance of science, there has been a tendency to slip into scientism, and assume that any factual claim can be authenticated if and only if the term ‘scientific’ can correctly be ascribed to it. The consequence is that non-scientific approaches to reality ― and that can include all the arts, religion, and personal, emotional and value-laden ways of encountering the world ― may become labelled as merely subjective, and therefore of little account in terms of describing the way the world is. The philosophy of science seeks to avoid crude scientism and get a balanced view on what the scientific method can and cannot achieve.",2,3,train
"According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the size and complexity of human populations was the driving force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival; their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As communities became larger, some people had time to reflect and debate. They found that they could understand and predict events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing these with observation and inference. But while a large population may have been necessary, in itself it was not sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big, but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science required a large and loosely structured, competitive community to support original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe.",5,3,train
"Over a period of time the buildings which housed social, legal, religious, and other rituals evolved into forms that we subsequently have come to recognize and associate with those buildings’ function. This is a two-way process; the building provides the physical environment and setting for a particular social ritual such as traveling by train or going to the theater, as well as the symbolic setting. The meaning of buildings evolves and becomes established by experience and we in turn read our experience into buildings. Buildings arouse an empathetic reaction in us through these projected experiences, and the strength of these reactions is determined by our culture, our beliefs, and our expectations. They tell stories, for their form and spatial organization give us hints about how they should be used. Their physical layout encourages some uses and inhibits others; we do not go backstage in a theater unless especially invited. Inside a law court the precise location of those involved in the legal process is an integral part of the design and an essential part of ensuring that the law is upheld.",2,3,train
"Mathematical models of flocks of birds and schools of fish and swarms of insects that move in unison demonstrate the same point: there is no central control of the movement of the group, but the group manifests a kind of collective intelligence that helps all within it to flee or discourage predators. This behavior does not reside within individual creatures but, rather, is a property of groups. Examination of flocks of birds “deciding” where to fly reveals that they move in a way that accounts for the intentions of all the birds, and, even more important, the direction of movement is usually the best choice for the flock. Each bird contributes a bit, and the flock’s concerted choice is better than an individual bird’s would be.",5,2,train
"Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for all meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences is, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever greater precision. But historical representation puts a premium on a proliferation of representations, hence not on the refinement of one representation but on the production of an ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight is not a matter of a continuous “narrowing down” of previous options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the contrary, is an “explosion” of possible points of view. It therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of determinacy and precision by the production of new and alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those previous representations. And from this perspective, the development of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the outsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous questioning of certainty and precision seemingly achieved already, rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation to the truth.",2,3,train
"Information encountered after an event can influence subsequent remembering. External information can easily integrate into a witness’s memory, especially if the event was poorly encoded or the memory is from a distant event, in which case time and forgetting have degraded the original memory. With reduced information available in memory with which to confirm the validity of post-event misinformation, it is less likely that this new information will be rejected. Instead, especially when it fits the witness’s current thinking and can be used to create a story that makes sense to him or her, it may be integrated as part of the original experience. This process can be explicit (i.e., the witness knows it is happening), but it is often unconscious. That is, the witness might find himself or herself thinking about the event differently without awareness. Over time, the witness may not even know the source of information that led to the (new) memory. Sources of misinformation in forensic contexts can be encountered anywhere, from discussions with other witnesses to social media searches to multiple interviews with investigators or other legal professionals, and even in court.",1,2,train
"In trying to explain how different disciplines attempt to understand autobiographical memory the literary critic Daniel Albright said, “Psychology is a garden, literature is a wilderness.” He meant, I believe, that psychology seeks to make patterns, find regularity, and ultimately impose order on human experience and behavior. Writers, by contrast, dive into the unruly, untamed depths of human experiences. What he said about understanding memory can be extended to our questions about young children’s minds. If we psychologists are too bent on identifying the orderly pattern, the regularities of children’s minds, we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of our topic: the child’s more unruly and imaginative ways of talking and thinking. It is not only the developed writer or literary scholar who seems drawn toward a somewhat wild and idiosyncratic way of thinking; young children are as well. The psychologist interested in young children may have to venture a little more often into the wilderness in order to get a good picture of how children think.",1,3,train
"The narratives that people create to understand their landscapes come to be viewed as marketable entities and a source of income for residents. Landscapes with a strong place identity have an advantage in marketing to tourists, as it is relatively easy to compartmentalize and market their narratives. Such places may have disadvantages as well, however. If place identity is tied to a particular industry, local residents may feel strongly attached to the definitions of place that stem from involvement in that industry, and they may resist losing that identity in favor of one based on a tourism industry. People rooted in landscape may feel strong connections to other community members and may resent the invasion of outsiders who they believe are different and challenge their common identity. Finally, local residents may feel that this process reduces their identities to mere commercial transactions, and they may believe they sacrifice what is unique and special about their place.",1,3,train
"There has been a lot of discussion on why moths are attracted to light. The consensus seems to hold that moths are not so much attracted to lights as they are trapped by them. The light becomes a sensory overload that disorients the insects and sends them into a holding pattern. A hypothesis called the Mach band theory suggests that moths see a dark area around a light source and head for it to escape the light. Another theory suggests that moths perceive the light coming from a source as a diffuse halo with a dark spot in the center. The moths, attempting to escape the light, fly toward that imagined “portal,” bringing them closer to the source. As they approach the light, their reference point changes and they circle the light hopelessly trying to reach the portal. Everyone is familiar with moths circling their porch lights. Their flight appears to have no purpose, but they are, it is believed, trying to escape the pull of the light.",2,3,train
"An invention or discovery that is too far ahead of its time is worthless; no one can follow. Ideally, an innovation opens up only the next step from what is known and invites the culture to move forward one hop. An overly futuristic, unconventional, or visionary invention can fail initially (it may lack essential not-yet-invented materials or a critical market or proper understanding) yet succeed later, when the ecology of supporting ideas catches up. Gregor Mendel’s 1865 theories of genetic heredity were correct but ignored for 35 years. His sharp insights were not accepted because they did not explain the problems biologists had at the time, nor did his explanation operate by known mechanisms, so his discoveries were out of reach even for the early adopters. Decades later science faced the urgent questions that Mendel’s discoveries could answer. Now his insights were only one step away. Within a few years of one another, three different scientists each independently rediscovered Mendel’s forgotten work, which of course had been there all along.",4,3,train
"The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget frequently analyzed children’s conception of time via their ability to compare or estimate the time taken by pairs of events. In a typical experiment, two toy cars were shown running synchronously on parallel tracks, one running faster and stopping further down the track. The children were then asked to judge whether the cars had run for the same time and to justify their judgment. Preschoolers and young school-age children confuse temporal and spatial dimensions: Starting times are judged by starting points, stopping times by stopping points and durations by distance, though each of these errors does not necessitate the others. Hence, a child may claim that the cars started and stopped running together (correct) and that the car which stopped further ahead, ran for more time (incorrect).",1,3,train
"City quality is so crucial for optional activities that the extent of staying activities can often be used as a measuring stick for the quality of the city as well as of its space. Many pedestrians in a city are not necessarily an indication of good city quality―many people walking around can often be a sign of insufficient transit options or long distances between the various functions in the city. Conversely, it can be claimed that a city in which many people are not walking often indicates good city quality. In a city like Rome, it is the large number of people standing or sitting in squares rather than walking that is conspicuous. And it’s not due to necessity but rather that the city quality is so inviting. It is hard to keep moving in city space with so many temptations to stay. In contrast are many new quarters and complexes that many people walk through but rarely stop or stay in.",1,3,train
"When people try to control situations that are essentially uncontrollable, they are inclined to experience high levels of stress. Thus, suggesting that they need to take active control is bad advice in those situations. What they need to do is to accept that some things are beyond their control. Similarly, teaching people to accept a situation that could readily be changed could be bad advice; sometimes the only way to get what you want is to take active control. Research has shown that when people who feel helpless fail to take control, they experience negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression. Like stress, these negative emotions can damage the immune response. We can see from this that health is not linearly related to control. For optimum health, people should be encouraged to take control to a point but to recognize when further control is impossible.",3,3,train

Rather, it’s difficult to remember last week’s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all the other lunches you’ve ever eaten as just another lunch. When we try to recall something from a category that includes as many instances as “lunch” or “wine,” many memories compete for our attention.

We gain mastery over the mechanics of language. We also gradually eliminate the logical gaps in our stories―characteristic of our earlier stage of perception―as intense preoccupation with the whole vision gives way to preoccupation with correctness. As a result, our writing and oral storying become increasingly conventional and literal, with an accompanying loss of the spontaneity and originality that characterized our earlier efforts. At this stage our vocabulary is firmly grounded. We use words everyone else uses. We have little need to invent metaphors to communicate.

"When two cultures come into contact, they do not exchange every cultural item. If that were the case, there would be no cultural differences in the world today. Instead, only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from one culture to another. Which cultural item is accepted depends largely on the item’s use and compatibility with already existing cultural traits. For example, it is not likely that men’s hair dyes designed to “get out the gray” will spread into parts of rural Africa where a person’s status is elevated with advancing years. Even when a(n) innovation is consistent with a society’s needs, there is still no guarantee that it will be accepted.

"Perceived distance of objects that are far away from the observer is often assumed to be subject to some global limitation in the sense that the moon, the stars, and the sun are all perceived at the “sky”: that is, at about the same distance. This observation is related to the idea that visual space is not open but ends at visible surfaces or, indeed, the sky. Uexküll and Kriszat (1934) suggested that this is realized as a hard limit, which they call the “farthest plane.” If an observed person or object would walk beyond this farthest plane, it would no longer be perceived as moving further away, but rather as shrinking in size. This observation is actually quite common; if looking down from a high tower, for example, cars or even houses on the ground below may appear as if they were toys: that is, shrunk, presumably because they are perceived at the distance of the farthest plane while subtending a visual angle that corresponds to a larger distance. The farthest plane would thus mark the limit of the perception of size constancy.",2,3,train
"Some people argue that there is a single, logically consistent concept known as reading that can be neatly set apart from everything else people do with books. Is reading really that simple? The most productive way to think about reading is as a loosely related set of behaviors that belong together owing to family resemblances, as Ludwig Wittgenstein used the phrase, without having in common a single defining trait. Consequently, efforts to distinguish reading from nonreading are destined to fail because there is no agreement on what qualifies as reading in the first place. The more one tries to figure out where the border lies between reading and not-reading, the more edge cases will be found to stretch the term’s flexible boundaries. Thus, it is worth attempting to collect together these exceptional forms of reading into a single forum, one highlighting the challenges faced by anyone wishing to establish the boundaries where reading begins and ends. The attempt moves toward an understanding of reading as a spectrum that is expansive enough to accommodate the distinct reading activities.",2,2,train

Over time, we lose our ability to interact with the unknown. Our approach reminds me of the classic story of the drunk man searching for his keys under a street lamp at night. He knows he lost his keys somewhere on the dark side of the street but looks for them underneath the lamp, because that’s where the light is. Our yearning for certainty leads us to pursue seemingly safe solutions—by looking for our keys under street lamps.

"To make plans for the future, the brain must have an ability to take certain elements of prior experiences and reconfigure them in a way that does not copy any actual past experience or present reality exactly. To accomplish that, the organism must go beyond the mere ability to form internal representations, the models of the world outside. It must acquire the ability to manipulate and transform these models. We can argue that tool-making, one of the fundamental distinguishing features of primate cognition, depends on this ability, since a tool does not exist in a ready-made form in the natural environment and has to be imagined in order to be made. The neural machinery for creating and holding ‘images of the future’ was a necessary prerequisite for tool-making, and thus for launching human civilization.",2,3,train

The counsellor helps the child to change by deconstructing old stories and reconstructing preferred stories about himself and his life. To help the child to develop a new story, the counsellor and child search for times when the problem has not influenced the child or the child’s life and focus on the different ways the child thought, felt and behaved. These exceptions to the problem story help the child create a new and preferred story.

For example, we would like to know the rate of natural soil formation from solid rock to determine whether topsoil erosion from agriculture is too great.

No occurrent feelings of love and respect need to be present throughout the period in which it is true that one loves or respects. One might therefore sometimes suspect, in the absence of the positive occurrent feelings, that one no longer loves. At such times, negative emotions like grief offer a kind of testimonial to the authenticity of love or respect.",1,3,train

It is almost unthinkable for a visitor to an art museum to admire a roomful of paintings without knowing the names of the individual painters, or for a reader not to know who the writer is of the novel she is reading.

"One unspoken truth about creativity ― it isn’t about wild talent so much as it is about productivity. To find a few ideas that work, you need to try a lot that don’t. It’s a pure numbers game. Geniuses don’t necessarily have a higher success rate than other creators; they simply do more ― and they do a range of different things. They have more successes and more failures. That goes for teams and companies too. It’s impossible to generate a lot of good ideas without also generating a lot of bad ideas. The thing about creativity is that at the outset, you can’t tell which ideas will succeed and which will fail. So the only thing you can do is try to fail faster so that you can move onto the next idea.",4,3,train
"Scientific knowledge cannot account for correct aesthetic appreciation of nature because science represents natural objects as members of a specific class, rather than as individual entities. The science-based approach claims that aesthetically relevant properties are only those properties that all members of a natural kind share with each other. But this is not true. When we experience nature, we do not experience it as species, but as individual objects. And as separated into individual objects, nature can have aesthetic properties that are not entailed by its scientific description. Natural science can explain, for instance, the formation of the waterfall, but it has nothing to say about our experience of the majestic Victoria Falls when viewed at sunset, its reds and oranges countless and captivating; geology can explain the formation of the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, but not its painful and breathtaking beauty at sunrise, the fog slowly lifting above the crater and a lone hippopotamus dark and heavy in the lake.",5,2,train
"A good deal of the information stored in working memory is encoded in an auditory form, especially when the information is language based. For example, in an early study by Conrad, adults were shown six-letter sequences, with letters being presented visually, one at a time, at intervals of three-fourths of a second. As soon as the last letter of a sequence had been presented, participants in the study wrote down all six of the letters they had seen, guessing at any letters they couldn’t easily recall. When people recalled letters incorrectly, the letters they said they had seen were more likely to resemble the actual stimuli in terms of how the letters sounded than how they looked. For example, the letter F was “remembered” as the auditorially similar letter S 131 times but as the visually similar letter P only 14 times. Similarly, the letter V was remembered as B 56 times but as X only 5 times.",2,3,train
"When trying to establish what is meant by digital preservation, the first question that must be addressed is: what are you actually trying to preserve? This is clear in the analog environment where the information content is inextricably fixed to the physical medium. In the digital environment, the medium is not part of the message. A bit stream looks the same to a computer regardless of the media it is read from. A physical carrier is necessary, but as long as the source media can be read, bit-perfect copies can be made cheaply and easily on other devices, making the preservation of the original carrier of diminishing importance. As the physical media that carry digital information are quite delicate relative to most analog media, it is expected that digital information will necessarily need to be migrated from one physical carrier to another as part of the ongoing preservation process. It is not the media itself but the information on the media that needs to be preserved.",3,3,train
"Politics cannot be suppressed, whichever policy process is employed and however sensitive and respectful of differences it might be. In other words, there is no end to politics. It is wrong to think that proper institutions, knowledge, methods of consultation, or participatory mechanisms can make disagreement go away. Theories of all sorts promote the view that there are ways by which disagreement can be processed or managed so as to make it disappear. The assumption behind those theories is that disagreement is wrong and consensus is the desirable state of things. In fact, consensus rarely comes without some forms of subtle coercion and the absence of fear in expressing a disagreement is a source of genuine freedom. Debates cause disagreements to evolve, often for the better, but a positively evolving debate does not have to equal a reduction in disagreement. The suppression of disagreement should never be made into a goal in political deliberation. A defense is required against any suggestion that political disagreement is not the normal state of things.",2,3,train

Even if a music lover kept his headphones on for every minute of every day for an entire year, he wouldn’t be able to listen to more than an eighth of all the albums that are released just in the United States in one year. Because we do not possess the capacity to give equal time to every artistic product that might come our way, we must rely on shortcuts. We may look for reviews and ratings of the latest movies before we decide which ones we’d like to see. We often let personal relationships guide our decisions about what art we allow into our lives. Also, we continually rely on the distribution systems through which we experience art ―museums, galleries, radio stations, television networks, etc.―to narrow the field of possibilities for us so that we don’t have to spend all of our energy searching for the next great thing.",1,3,train
"When trying to understand the role of the sun in ancient journeys, the sources become fewer and the journeys less well known. Herodotus writes about an exploratory voyage commissioned by the ancient Egyptian King Necho II in about 600 BC. Necho II reportedly ordered a Phoenician expedition to sail clockwise around Africa, starting at the Red Sea and returning to the mouth of the Nile. They were gone for three years. Herodotus writes that the Phoenicians, upon returning from their heroic expedition, reported that after sailing south and then turning west, they found the sun was on their right, the opposite direction to where they were used to seeing it or expecting it to be. Contemporary astronomical science was simply not strong enough to fabricate such an accurate, fundamental and yet prosaic detail of where the sun would be after sailing past the equator and into the southern hemisphere. It is this that leads many of today’s historians to conclude that the journey must have taken place.",1,3,train
"Concepts of nature are always cultural statements. This may not strike Europeans as much of an insight, for Europe’s landscape is so much of a blend. But in the new worlds― ‘new’ at least to Europeans―the distinction appeared much clearer not only to European settlers and visitors but also to their descendants. For that reason, they had the fond conceit of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations which could later find expression in an admiration for wilderness. Ecological relationships certainly have their own logic and in this sense ‘nature’ can be seen to have a self-regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent of human intervention. But the context for ecological interactions has increasingly been set by humanity. We may not determine how or what a lion eats but we certainly can regulate where the lion feeds.",2,3,train
"With population growth slowing, the strongest force increasing demand for more agricultural production will be rising incomes, which are desired by practically all governments and individuals. Although richer people spend smaller proportions of their income on food, in total they consume more food ― and richer food, which contributes to various kinds of disease and debilitation. The changes in diet that usually accompany higher incomes will require relatively greater increases in the production of feed grains, rather than food grains, as foods of animal origin partly displace plant-based foods in people’s diets. It takes two to six times more grain to produce food value through animals than to get the equivalent value directly from plants. It is thus quite credible to estimate that in order to meet economic and social needs within the next three to five decades, the world should be producing more than twice as much grain and agricultural products as at present, but in ways that these are accessible to the food-insecure.",1,3,train
"One of the factors determining the use of technologies of communication will be the kinds of investments made in equipment and personnel; who makes them, and what they expect in return. There is no guarantee that the investment will necessarily be in forms of communication that are most appropriate for the majority of people. Because the ownership of investment funds tends to be in the hands of commercial organisations, the modernisation of communications infrastructure only takes place on the basis of potential profitability. Take, for example, the installation of fibre-optic communications cable across the African continent. A number of African nations are involved in the development but its operational structures will be oriented to those who can pay for access. Many states that might wish to use it for education and information may not only find it too expensive but also simply unavailable to them. There can be no doubt that the development has been led by investment opportunity rather than community demand.",2,3,train

When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into the GPS, whose spatial memory supplants my own. When I sit down to work, I open up a notebook that holds the contents of my interviews. Now, thanks to the Internet, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind’s collective memory. Growing up, in the days when you still had to press seven buttons, or turn a clunky rotary dial, to make a telephone call, I could recall the numbers of all my close friends and family. Today, I’m not sure if I know more than four phone numbers by heart. And that’s probably more than most people do. Our gadgets eliminate the need to remember such things.",2,2,train
"All athletes have an innate preference for task­ or ego­involved goals in sport. These predispositions, referred to as task and ego goal orientations, are believed to develop throughout childhood largely due to the types of people the athletes come in contact with and the situations they are placed in. If children consistently receive parental praise depending on their effort and recognition for personal improvement from their coaches, and are encouraged to learn from their mistakes, then they are likely to foster a task orientation. It becomes natural for them to believe that success is associated with mastery, effort, understanding, and personal responsibility. The behavior of their role models in sport also affects this development. Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non­selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition. This kind of environment helps an ego orientation to flourish, along with the belief that ability and talent, not effort and personal endeavor, earn success.",4,3,train
"Lewis­Williams believes that the religious view of hunter groups was a contract between the hunter and the hunted. ‘The powers of the underworld allowed people to kill animals, provided people responded in certain ritual ways, such as taking fragments of animals into the caves and inserting them into the “membrane”.’ This is borne out in the San. Like other shamanistic societies, they have admiring practices between human hunters and their prey, suffused with taboos derived from extensive natural knowledge. These practices suggest that honouring may be one method of softening the disquiet of killing. It should be said that this disquiet needn’t arise because there is something fundamentally wrong with a human killing another animal, but simply because we are aware of doing the killing. And perhaps, too, because in some sense we ‘know’ what we are killing. We make sound guesses that the pain and desire for life we feel—our worlds of experience—have a counterpart in the animal we kill. As predators, this can create problems for us. One way to smooth those edges, then, is to view that prey with respect.",1,3,train
"People unknowingly sabotage their own work when they withhold help or information from others or try to undermine them lest they become more successful or get more credit than “me.” Cooperation is alien to the ego, except when there is a secondary motive. The ego doesn’t know that the more you include others, the more smoothly things flow and the more easily things come to you. When you give little or no help to others or put obstacles in their path, the universe ― in the form of people and circumstances ― gives little or no help to you because you have cut yourself off from the whole. The ego’s unconscious core feeling of “not enough” causes it to react to someone else’s success as if that success had taken something away from “me.” It doesn’t know that your resentment of another person’s success curtails your own chances of success. In order to attract success, you need to welcome it wherever you see it.",5,3,train
"It’s a common practice during creativity seminars to give participants a bag full of materials and then a problem to solve. The materials are usually everyday items. Their use is obvious to all. You are then to use those materials in whatever ways you want to solve the problem; however, there isn’t usually an obvious connection between the items and your problem. For instance, maybe you have to figure out how to create a communication device using a hammer, tape, a hairbrush, and a bag of marbles. Most people have a cognitive bias called functional fixedness that causes them to see objects only in their normal context. The use of the materials in their ordinary way will generally lead to no workable solutions. The really exciting solutions come from overcoming functional fixedness and using these everyday items in new ways. To see the possibilities it is helpful to take the viewpoint that nothing is what you think it is.",2,3,train
"Gordon Allport argued that history records many individuals who were not content with an existence that offered them little variety, a lack of psychic tension, and minimal challenge. Allport considers it normal to be pulled forward by a vision of the future that awakened within persons their drive to alter the course of their lives. He suggests that people possess a need to invent motives and purposes that would consume their inner energies. Similarly, Erich Fromm proposed a need on the part of humans to rise above the roles of passive creatures in an accidental if not random world. To him, humans are driven to transcend the state of merely having been created; instead, humans seek to become the creators, the active shapers of their own destiny. Rising above the passive and accidental nature of existence, humans generate their own purposes and thereby provide themselves with a true basis of freedom.",1,3,train
"Japanese used to have a color word, ao, that spanned both green and blue. In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists’ palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese. Rather than alter the name to fit reality, the Japanese government announced in 1973 that reality should be altered to fit the name: henceforth, go lights would be a color that better corresponded to the dominant meaning of ao.",1,3,train
"Long before Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass, poets had addressed themselves to fame. Horace, Petrarch, Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats all hoped that poetic greatness would grant them a kind of earthly immortality. Whitman held a similar faith that for centuries the world would value his poems. But to this ancient desire to live forever on the page, he added a new sense of fame. Readers would not simply attend to the poet’s work; they would be attracted to the greatness of his personality. They would see in his poems a vibrant cultural performance, an individual springing from the book with tremendous charisma and appeal. Out of the political rallies and electoral parades that marked Jacksonian America, Whitman defined poetic fame in relation to the crowd. Other poets might look for their inspiration from the goddess of poetry. Whitman’s poet sought the approval of his contemporaries. In the instability of American democracy, fame would be dependent on celebrity, on the degree to which the people rejoiced in the poet and his work.",4,3,train
"Enabling animals to operate in the presence of harmless stimuli is an almost universal function of learning. Most animals innately avoid objects they have not previously encountered. Unfamiliar objects may be dangerous; treating them with caution has survival value. If persisted in, however, such careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution would be lost. A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never win races, not even with a lazy rabbit. To overcome this problem, almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur frequently. Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile.",4,3,train
"The critic who wants to write about literature from a formalist perspective must first be a close and careful reader who examines all the elements of a text individually and questions how they come together to create a work of art. Such a reader, who respects the autonomy of a work, achieves an understanding of it by looking inside it, not outside it or beyond it. Instead of examining historical periods, author biographies, or literary styles, for example, he or she will approach a text with the assumption that it is a self-contained entity and that he or she is looking for the governing principles that allow the text to reveal itself. For example, the correspondences between the characters in James Joyce’s short story “Araby” and the people he knew personally may be interesting, but for the formalist they are less relevant to understanding how the story creates meaning than are other kinds of information that the story contains within itself.",4,3,train
"The commonsense understanding of the moral status of altruistic acts conforms to how most of us think about our responsibilities toward others. We tend to get offended when someone else or society determines for us how much of what we have should be given away; we are adults and should have the right to make such decisions for ourselves. Yet, when interviewed, altruists known for making the largest sacrifices—and bringing about the greatest benefits to their recipients—assert just the opposite. They insist that they had absolutely no choice but to act as they did. Organ donors, and everyday citizens who risk their own lives to save others in mortal danger are remarkably consistent in their explicit denials that they have done anything deserving of high praise as well as in their assurance that anyone in their shoes should have done exactly the same thing. To be sure, it seems that the more altruistic someone is, the more they are likely to insist that they have done no more than all of us would be expected to do, lest we shirk our basic moral obligation to humanity.",1,3,train
"Observational studies of humans cannot be properly controlled. Humans live different lifestyles and in different environments. Thus, they are insufficiently homogeneous to be suitable experimental subjects. These confounding factors undermine our ability to draw sound causal conclusions from human epidemiological surveys. Confounding factors are variables (known or unknown) that make it difficult for epidemiologists to isolate the effects of the specific variable being studied. For example, Taubes argued that since many people who drink also smoke, researchers have difficulty determining the link between alcohol consumption and cancer. Similarly, researchers in the famous Framingham study identified a significant correlation between coffee drinking and coronary heart disease. However, most of this correlation disappeared once researchers corrected for the fact that many coffee drinkers also smoke. If the confounding factors are known, it is often possible to correct for them. However, if they are unknown, they will undermine the reliability of the causal conclusions we draw from epidemiological surveys.",2,2,train
"Among the most fascinating natural temperature-regulating behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants. These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature in their hives or mounds throughout the year. The constancy of these microclimates depends not just on the location and insulation of the habitat, but on the activity of the insects in the colony. When the surrounding temperature increases, the activity in the hive decreases, which decreases the amount of heat generated by insect metabolism. In fact, many animals decrease their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold, and people who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body temperature. This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia and hyperthermia.",1,3,train
"Development can get very complicated and fanciful. A fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process could go, when a single melodic line, sometimes just a handful of notes, was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent structure. Ludwig van Beethoven’s famous Fifth Symphony provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping. The opening da-da-da-DUM that everyone has heard somewhere or another appears in an incredible variety of ways throughout not only the opening movement, but the remaining three movements, like a kind of motto or a connective thread. Just as we don’t always see the intricate brushwork that goes into the creation of a painting, we may not always notice how Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he develops his material into a large, cohesive statement. But a lot of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from the inventiveness behind it, the impressive development of musical ideas.",2,3,train

"In the less developed world, the percentage of the population involved in agriculture is declining, but at the same time, those remaining in agriculture are not benefiting from technological advances. The typical scenario in the less developed world is one in which a very few commercial agriculturalists are technologically advanced while the vast majority are incapable of competing. Indeed, this vast majority have lost control over their own production because of larger global causes. As an example, in Kenya, farmers are actively encouraged to grow export crops such as tea and coffee at the expense of basic food production. The result is that a staple crop, such as maize, is not being produced in a sufficient amount. The essential argument here is that the capitalist mode of production is affecting peasant production in the less developed world in such a way as to limit the production of staple foods, thus causing a food problem.",1,3,valid
"Let me spend a moment on the idea of adjusting to another person’s mental orientation. What I mean is this. At any moment, a person has a particular take on what is happening. The person notices this rather than that, and she has feelings and makes judgements about one rather than another aspect of events. If she is hungry, for example, she may notice that a shop is selling groceries; her friend may notice only that it sells newspapers. If she is short of money, she may resent that the fruit is overpriced; meanwhile her friend may feel tempted by some juicy peaches. In one sense the two friends are experiencing the same shop and its contents, but they are having quite different experiences of that shop. A more extreme case arises when one person comprehends things in a peculiar and individual way, for instance, in mistaking the shop for a cinema.",4,3,valid
"Since life began in the oceans, most life, including freshwater life, has a chemical composition more like the ocean than fresh water. It appears that most freshwater life did not originate in fresh water, but is secondarily adapted, having passed from ocean to land and then back again to fresh water. As improbable as this may seem, the bodily fluids of aquatic animals show a strong similarity to oceans, and indeed, most studies of ion balance in freshwater physiology document the complex regulatory mechanisms by which fish, amphibians and invertebrates attempt to maintain an inner ocean in spite of surrounding fresh water. It is these sorts of unexpected complexities and apparent contradictions that make ecology so interesting. The idea of a fish in a freshwater lake struggling to accumulate salts inside its body to mimic the ocean reminds one of the other great contradiction of the biosphere: plants are bathed in an atmosphere composed of roughly three-quarters nitrogen, yet their growth is frequently restricted by lack of nitrogen.",1,3,valid

This effect was reversed, however, when the seating arrangement was either angular (think L­shaped) or square. These seating arrangements tended to activate people’s need for uniqueness. As a result, people were more responsive and reacted more favorably to messages and proposals that were self­oriented and that allowed them to elevate their individualism.",1,3,valid
"All translators feel some pressure from the community of readers for whom they are doing their work. And all translators arrive at their interpretations in dialogue with other people.

He had Greek commentaries to refer to, and translations that had already been done in English, Latin, and French―and of course he had dictionaries. Translators always draw on more than one source text. Even when the scene of translation consists of just one person with a pen, paper, and the book that is being translated, or even when it is just one person translating orally for another, that person’s linguistic knowledge arises from lots of other texts and other conversations. And then his or her idea of the translation’s purpose will be influenced by the expectations of the person or people it is for.

"The empiricist philosopher John Locke argued that when the human being was first born, the mind was simply a blank slate—a tabula rasa—waiting to be written on by experience. Locke believed that our experience shapes who we are and who we become—and therefore he also believed that, given different experiences, human beings would have different characters. The influence of these ideas was profound, particularly for the new colonies in America, for example, because these were conscious attempts to make a new start and to form a new society. The new society was to operate on a different basis from that of European culture, which was based on the feudal system in which people’s place in society was almost entirely determined by birth, and which therefore tended to emphasize innate characteristics. Locke’s emphasis on the importance of experience in forming the human being provided an optimistic framework for those trying to form a different society.",3,3,valid

That means 95 percent of Americans have jobs, an employment rate much higher than that of most other industrial nations. But let’s spin the figure another way. In a country as populous as the United States, unemployment at 5 percent means that millions of Americans don’t earn a daily wage. Indeed, one out of every twenty adults who wants work can’t find it. Suddenly that’s a sobering number. And, as you can see, the same statistic can be cited as a cause for celebration or shame.",2,2,valid

The quality of the experience suffers too, as we become less aware or ‘mindful.’ Have you ever eaten an entire meal without tasting any of it? Hurrying up doesn’t just give us less time, it can also steal the pleasure and benefit from the time that we do have. For many of us, hurrying is a way of life.

History is an exciting act of interpretation—taking the facts of the past and weaving them into a compelling narrative. The historian works closely with the stuff that has been left behind—documents, oral testimony, objects—to make the past come alive.

"Students of ethics have been perplexed whether to classify their subject as a science, an art, or otherwise. The objection to including ethics among the sciences is that, whereas science deals with what is, ethics, it is said, is concerned with what ought to be. This, at the first glimpse, appears to be a valid and useful distinction; but mature reflection reveals that it is superficial and not wholly true. Much of the confusion and disorientation in contemporary ethics may be traced to just this refusal to recognize that ethics, no less than physics, is concerned with actually existent situations and with energies that cause clearly demonstrable effects. In the first place, our opinion of what ought to be lacks authority if it ignores what already exists. Any one of our most fanciful dreams might with equal force command our present efforts, unless we insist that our notions of what ought to be are somehow related to present realities. Even from this point of view, ethics must be more than the consideration of imaginary states that might satisfy our highest moral aspirations.",1,3,valid
"It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe sizes. But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of features of the process of human development from infancy to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in common.",5,3,valid
"Over 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth’s primordial atmosphere was probably largely water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen. The appearance and subsequent evolution of exceedingly primitive living organisms (bacteria-like microbes and simple single-celled plants) began to change the atmosphere, liberating oxygen and breaking down carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. This made it possible for higher organisms to develop. When the earliest known plant cells with nuclei evolved about 2 billion years ago, the atmosphere seems to have had only about 1 percent of its present content of oxygen. With the emergence of the first land plants, about 500 million years ago, oxygen reached about one-third of its present concentration. It had risen to almost its present level by about 370 million years ago, when animals first spread on to land. Today’s atmosphere is thus not just a requirement to sustain life as we know it―it is also a consequence of life.",2,2,valid

One prime example involved six young chimpanzees being studied in the 1970s at the Delta Primate Research Center. One of them (we’ll call him the “leader”) was introduced alone into an enclosure and shown either a hidden source of food or a stuffed snake. When this chimp was reunited with his fellows outside the enclosure, they quickly resumed their normal activities. There was no readily apparent sign that the leader communicated his important knowledge to the other chimps. Yet, when all six were allowed into the enclosure after the leader had been shown food, the group headed straight for the food. In the “snake” condition, the chimps all entered the enclosure with the fur on their backs spiking up and approached the danger zone with extreme caution, poking at the leaf bed with sticks rather than with their hands. Either the leader chimp had conveyed the information to the others, or they were superbly attuned to his intentions.",2,3,valid
"Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and gathering, and, in a shifting pattern of life in search of new sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and adaptability were dominant criteria. With the evolution of more settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics, other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life, rapidly emerged. It must be emphasized, however, that tradition was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations appropriate to people and their circumstances. Although traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups, specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs. A chair could keep its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific person. This basic principle of customization allowed a constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced, which, if demonstrated by experience to be advantageous, could be integrated back into the mainstream of tradition.",2,3,valid

Ideas that are original but not useful are irrelevant, and ideas that are useful but not original are unremarkable. While this definition is widely used in research, an important aspect of creativity is often ignored: Generating creative ideas rarely is the final goal. Rather, to successfully solve problems or innovate requires one or a few good ideas that really work, and work better than previous approaches. This requires that people evaluate the products of their own or each other’s imagination, and choose those ideas that seem promising enough to develop further, and abandon those that are unlikely to be successful. Thus, being creative does not stop with idea generation. In fact, the ability to generate creative ideas is essentially useless if these ideas subsequently die a silent death.",1,3,valid
"Through recent decades academic archaeologists have been urged to conduct their research and excavations according to hypothesis-testing procedures. It has been argued that we should construct our general theories, deduce testable propositions and prove or disprove them against the sampled data. In fact, the application of this ‘scientific method’ often ran into difficulties. The data have a tendency to lead to unexpected questions, problems and issues. Thus, archaeologists claiming to follow hypothesis-testing procedures found themselves having to create a fiction. In practice, their work and theoretical conclusions partly developed from the data which they had discovered. In other words, they already knew the data when they decided upon an interpretation. But in presenting their work they rewrote the script, placing the theory first and claiming to have tested it against data which they discovered, as in an experiment under laboratory conditions.",1,3,valid
"The meritocratic emphasis on effort and hard work seeks to vindicate the idea that, under the right conditions, we are responsible for our success and thus capable of freedom. It also seeks to vindicate the faith that, if the competition is truly fair, success will align with virtue; those who work hard and play by the rules will earn the rewards they deserve. We want to believe that success, in sports and in life, is something we earn, not something we inherit. Natural gifts and the advantages they bring embarrass the meritocratic faith. They cast doubt on the conviction that praise and rewards flow from effort alone. In the face of this embarrassment, we inflate the moral significance of effort and striving. This can be seen, for example, in television coverage of the Olympics, which focuses less on the feats the athletes perform than on heartbreaking stories of the hardships and obstacles they have overcome, and the struggles they have gone through to triumph over injury, or a difficult childhood, or political turmoil in their native land.",2,3,valid
"Humour involves not just practical disengagement but cognitive disengagement. As long as something is funny, we are for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or fictional, true or false. This is why we give considerable leeway to people telling funny stories. If they are getting extra laughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by making up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic licence, a kind of poetic licence. Indeed, someone listening to a funny story who tries to correct the teller―‘No, he didn’t spill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the keyboard’―will probably be told by the other listeners to stop interrupting. The creator of humour is putting ideas into people’s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to provide accurate information.",1,3,test
"The creativity that children possess needs to be cultivated throughout their development. Research suggests that overstructuring the child’s environment may actually limit creative and academic development. This is a central problem with much of science instruction. The exercises or activities are devised to eliminate different options and to focus on predetermined results. The answers are structured to fit the course assessments, and the wonder of science is lost along with cognitive intrigue. We define cognitive intrigue as the wonder that stimulates and intrinsically motivates an individual to voluntarily engage in an activity. The loss of cognitive intrigue may be initiated by the sole use of play items with predetermined conclusions and reinforced by rote instruction in school. This is exemplified by toys, games, and lessons that are a(n) end in and of themselves and require little of the individual other than to master the planned objective.",1,3,test
"A sleeping mother has the ability to identify the particular cry of her own baby. This is one of the bonding factors that has been forgotten because of the way in which we live today. Typically, there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment, so there is no way to test this ability. In an ancient tribe, however, living in small huts in a tiny village settlement, a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night. If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food, she might get no sleep at all. During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby. This sensitivity is still there to this day, even though it is seldom used.",5,3,test
"Sometimes, however, if a person is already sensitive and upset about something, delaying feedback can be wise. Use your critical thinking skills to analyze when feedback will do the most good. Rather than automatically offering immediate correction, use the just-in-time approach and provide feedback just before the person might make another mistake.",1,3,test
"Over the last decade the attention given to how children learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages make texts mean. ‘Reading’ now applies to a greater number of representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures, maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible in picture books by new printing processes, design features also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated kind of interpretation than it was when children’s attention was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading is not simply word recognition. Even in the easiest texts, what a sentence ‘says’ is often not what it means.",2,3,test
"Finkenauer and Rimé investigated the memory of the unexpected death of Belgium’s King Baudouin in 1993 in a large sample of Belgian citizens. The data revealed that the news of the king’s death had been widely socially shared. By talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event. At the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the personal circumstances in which the event took place, an effect known as “flashbulb memory.” The more an event is socially shared, the more it will be fixed in people’s minds. Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural tendency people may have. Naturally, people should be driven to “forget” undesirable events. Thus, someone who just heard a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened. The social sharing of the bad news contributes to repetitive realism.",3,3,test
"Digital technology accelerates dematerialization by hastening the migration from products to services. The liquid nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to materials. But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. The reason even solid physical goods ― like a soda can ― can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. The tangible is replaced by intangibles ― intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity ― that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act as if they were intangible services. Nouns morph to verbs. Hardware behaves like software. In Silicon Valley they say it like this: “Software eats everything.”",1,3,test
"When you begin to tell a story again that you have retold many times, what you retrieve from memory is the index to the story itself. That index can be embellished in a variety of ways. Over time, even the embellishments become standardized. An old man’s story that he has told hundreds of times shows little variation, and any variation that does exist becomes part of the story itself, regardless of its origin. People add details to their stories that may or may not have occurred. They are recalling indexes and reconstructing details. If at some point they add a nice detail, not really certain of its validity, telling the story with that same detail a few more times will ensure its permanent place in the story index. In other words, the stories we tell time and again are identical to the memory we have of the events that the story relates.",1,3,test
"For several years much research in psychology was based on the assumption that human beings are driven by base motivations such as aggression, egoistic self-interest, and the pursuit of simple pleasures. Since many psychologists began with that assumption, they inadvertently designed research studies that supported their own presuppositions. Consequently, the view of humanity that prevailed in psychology was that of a species barely keeping its aggressive tendencies in check and managing to live in social groups more out of motivated self-interest than out of a genuine affinity for others or a true sense of community. Both Sigmund Freud and the early behaviorists led by John B. Watson believed that humans were motivated primarily by selfish drives. From that perspective, social interaction is possible only by exerting control over those baser emotions and, therefore, it is always vulnerable to eruptions of violence, greed, and selfishness. The fact that humans actually live together in social groups has traditionally been seen as a tenuous arrangement that is always just one step away from violence.",2,2,test
"Are the different types of mobile device, smartphones and tablets, substitutes or complements? Let’s explore this question by considering the case of Madeleine and Alexandra, two users of these devices. Madeleine uses her tablet to take notes in class. These notes are synced to her smartphone wirelessly, via a cloud computing service, allowing Madeleine to review her notes on her phone during the bus trip home. Alexandra uses both her phone and tablet to surf the Internet, write emails and check social media. Both of these devices allow Alexandra to access online services when she is away from her desktop computer. For Madeleine, smartphones and tablets are complements. She gets greater functionality out of her two devices when they are used together. For Alexandra, they are substitutes. Both smartphones and tablets fulfil more or less the same function in Alexandra’s life. This case illustrates the role that an individual consumer’s behavior plays in determining the nature of the relationship between two goods or services.",2,2,test
"Plants are genius chemists. They rely on their ability to manufacture chemical compounds for every single aspect of their survival. A plant with juicy leaves can’t run away to avoid being eaten. It relies on its own chemical defenses to kill microbes, deter pests, or poison would­be predators. Plants also need to reproduce. They can’t impress a potential mate with a fancy dance, a victory in horn­to­horn combat, or a well­constructed nest like animals do. Since plants need to attract pollinators to accomplish reproduction, they’ve evolved intoxicating scents, sweet nectar, and pheromones that send signals that bees and butterflies can’t resist. When you consider that plants solve almost all of their problems by making chemicals, and that there are nearly 400,000 species of plants on Earth, it’s no wonder that the plant kingdom is a source for a dazzling array of useful substances.",2,3,test
"Although most people, including Europe’s Muslims, have numerous identities, few of these are politically salient at any moment. It is only when a political issue affects the welfare of those in a particular group that identity assumes importance. For instance, when issues arise that touch on women’s rights, women start to think of gender as their principal identity. Whether such women are American or Iranian or whether they are Catholic or Protestant matters less than the fact that they are women. Similarly, when famine and civil war threaten people in sub-Saharan Africa, many African-Americans are reminded of their kinship with the continent in which their ancestors originated centuries earlier, and they lobby their leaders to provide humanitarian relief. In other words, each issue calls forth somewhat different identities that help explain the political preferences people have regarding those issues.",1,3,test
"Prior to photography, places did not travel well. While painters have always lifted particular places out of their ‘dwelling’ and transported them elsewhere, paintings were time-consuming to produce, relatively difficult to transport and one-of-a-kind. The multiplication of photographs especially took place with the introduction of the half-tone plate in the 1880s that made possible the mechanical reproduction of photographs in newspapers, periodicals, books and advertisements. Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism’s arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations ... achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass- produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images. Light, small and mass-produced photographs became dynamic vehicles for the spatiotemporal circulation of places.",5,3,test
"In labor-sharing groups, people contribute labor to other people on a regular basis (for seasonal agricultural work such as harvesting) or on an irregular basis (in the event of a crisis such as the need to rebuild a barn damaged by fire). Labor sharing groups are part of what has been called a “moral economy” since no one keeps formal records on how much any family puts in or takes out. Instead, accounting is socially regulated. The group has a sense of moral community based on years of trust and sharing. In a certain community of North America, labor sharing is a major economic factor of social cohesion. When a family needs a new barn or faces repair work that requires group labor, a barn-raising party is called. Many families show up to help. Adult men provide manual labor, and adult women provide food for the event. Later, when another family needs help, they call on the same people.",3,3,test
"Even as mundane a behavior as watching TV may be a way for some people to escape painful self-awareness through distraction. To test this idea, Sophia Moskalenko and Steven Heine gave participants false feedback about their test performance, and then seated each one in front of a TV set to watch a video as the next part of the study. When the video came on, showing nature scenes with a musical soundtrack, the experimenter exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly to get the correct one, leaving the participant alone as the video played. The participants who had received failure feedback watched the video much longer than those who thought they had succeeded. The researchers concluded that distraction through television viewing can effectively relieve the discomfort associated with painful failures or mismatches between the self and self-guides. In contrast, successful participants had little wish to be distracted from their self-related thoughts!",2,3,test
"Imagine tossing a coin over and over, and let’s say that the coin has landed heads up six times in a row. Many people believe that in this situation the coin is more likely to come up tails than heads on the next toss. But this conclusion is wrong, and this belief is commonly referred to as the “gambler’s fallacy.” The logic leading to this fallacy seems to be that if the coin is fair, then a series of tosses should contain equal numbers of heads and tails. If no tails have appeared for a while, then some are overdue to bring about this balance. But how could this be? The coin has no memory, so it has no way of knowing how long it has been since the last tails. More generally, there simply is no mechanism through which the history of the previous tosses could influence the current one. Therefore, the likelihood of a tail on toss number 7 is 50-50, just as it was on the first toss, and just as it is on every toss.",5,2,test
"One factor that may hinder creativity is unawareness of the resources required in each activity in students’ learning. Often students are unable to identify the resources they need to perform the task required of them. Different resources may be compulsory for specific learning tasks, and recognizing them may simplify the activity’s performance. For example, it may be that students desire to conduct some experiments in their projects. There must be a prior investigation of whether the students will have access to the laboratory, equipment, and chemicals required for the experiment. It means preparation is vital for the students to succeed, and it may be about human and financial resources such as laboratory technicians, money to purchase chemicals, and equipment for their learning where applicable. Even if some of the resources required for a task may not be available, identifying them in advance may help students’ creativity. It may even lead to changing the topic, finding alternative resources, and other means.",5,2,test
"My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not cured the world’s ills by abolishing wars and starvation; that gross human inequality is still widespread; that happiness is not universal. My friend made a common mistake ― a basic misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is amoral ― not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further their favorite hopes for society ―and this is the fundamental flaw. Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate view, but to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd. To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social or moral application.",1,3,test
